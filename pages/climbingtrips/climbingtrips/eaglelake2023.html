<p>Eagle lake buttress is a pretty cool area not going to lie. I had never been to eagle lake at all and even actively avoided it. 
    I had grown up semi in the area and had heard horror stories of how crowded the trail would get.</p>
<p>Even though we parked pretty early, the trailhead was packed. Absolute shit show. Luckily, it only takes about 45 minutes to 
    get to the lake and no tourists venture past that point. The rest of the approach to the eagle lake buttress was pretty chill
     and was just talus hopping in a gully.</p>
<p>The plan for the day was to do the eagle buttress traverse with my friends Derek and Marco. The traverse is mainly 4th class
     with a few bits of low 5th i think. Regardless, we decided to bring a rope and a sparse rack just in case. At minimum we 
     could do some short roping practice or whatever.</p>
<p>After arriving at the buttress though we all saw a line that looked epic to climb. It turned out to be the Eagle Route which
     goes at 5.6 and is an epic introduction to semi alpine climbing. It's normally done in 3 pitches I believe.</p>
<p>We soloed up the first section of pitch 1 to a ledge where we roped up and got rock shoes on. I led the pitch that ended up 
    being very enjoyable. My rack was very light and I had brought hexes too for fun so it was pretty fun to protect. Some people 
    say this pitch is 5.5, which it generally is, except for one spot where it's 5.6/7.</p>
<p>I belayed marco up to me and we chilled at the anchor. The pitch was pretty long so we had to drop the whole rope back down 
    for Derek to tie in and for me to bring him up. Not the best plan but it worked out.</p>

<p>The second pitch was a cool flared chimney that was a blast (sarcasm) to climb with a backpack on. Then it was fun 4th class 
    to a huge belay ledge. We had Marco tied into the middle of the rope, and Derek in the end so we didn't need any shenanigans 
    to bring them both up.</p>
<p>I think the intended route climbs around to the left of the spire and then to the top. However, there was a very intriguing 
    offwidth crack right above us that got the best of my curiosity. It was a confusing and awkward crack but hey that's what i 
    signed up for. On the summit i slung some blocks and belayed up everyone else.</p>

<p>We downclimbed the 4th class on the other side of the spire and called it a day as the sun set. Unfortunately we had forgotten 
    about the ridge traverse but still felt pretty content. The easy climbing and stellar views made for a great day.</p>
<p>On the way out we realized none of us had flashlights so all 3 of us had to talus hop by the light from one iphone. Pretty 
    classic.</p>
<p>The next 2 days were spent climbing at donner summit and were pretty chill but don't really warrant a whole trip report.</p>
