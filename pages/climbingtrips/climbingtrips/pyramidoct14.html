<p><em>This one is more of a creative piece be warned I guess.</em></p>
  <p>A light breeze chased me down the West Ridge of Pyramid Peak. Gaining on me.</p>
  <p>Hopping from talus to scree, sliding, then leaping to talus again. Carrying on west. I am coasting. Effortlessly. 
    Manzanita twigs lunge for my ankles yet seldom catch the sole of my boots.</p>
  <p>Why is this hitting me now? A gust of mountain wind straight to the face- I’m frozen in my tracks. It caught me.</p>
  <p>Something is wrong with me. I don’t know what- neither do the doctors. What is going on? The mountains aren’t replying. 
    It’s rare that they don’t have the answers.</p>
  <p>Every week I push my limits on any climb I can find, reaching summit after summit. I’ve become accustomed to the risk 
    involved, acknowledging that one day I might push my limits too far. It’s a slap in the face that I’m stuck at home when my 
    body decides to do me in.</p>
  <p>For months, the hallucinations have been getting stronger- more frequent. Three times this week alone I’ve fought to keep 
    myself from passing out in the middle of downtown. Eventually I landed myself in the ER. Things are getting worse.</p>
  <p>Now, I'm laying in the dirt, gasping for air. Not from altitude. Tears charge down my face.</p>
  <p>Sand is harder to grasp with wind-chapped hands.</p>
  <p>Five sixths of my brain is screaming at me to get up but my body can’t respond. In a view from above, I see myself sitting 
    in my backyard, in a wheelchair, struggling to push it into the pool.</p>
  <p>Only the mountains can do this to me. Time and time again they call me over, force the truth upon me, then pat me on the 
    back as I storm out the door in rage. Deep down I know that they’re just looking out for me.</p>
  <p>This is what gives me a sense of accomplishment. I just submitted Pyramid Peak in record time (my PR) and was on track to 
    cut my car 2 car record time in half. I’m in great shape right now, I better use it while I am still able to. That's
     my motivation at the moment. That’s what I'm holding on to. </p>
  <p>The sun’s setting now, I guess I’ll keep going, I’ll be faster in the dark.</p>
