<p>Warm chicken noodle soup makes an alright breakfast after waking up on the side of the road. Luke and I had slept on Carson Pass
so that we could wake up early and get a good start on the East Ridge of Round Top. Neither of us are really early risers so 
7am was our alpine start.</p>
<p>The approach to the ridge goes past Frog Lake, which was still completely frozen over. It was nice to have snow on the ground 
so that we could just hike to the climb instead of following the trail. There were some pretty brutal sun cups though on the
west side of Elephant's Back.</p>
<p>I really wanted to ski the remaining snow across the pass on Red Lake Peak.</p>
<p>Right at the base of Elephants Back, there were two lagunitas sitting in a sun sup. They looked like they had been there for 
quite some time so we didnt really want to drink them. We still hiked them out though since they looked forgotten. Sorry for 
swiping your beer if they were left there on purpose.</p>
<p>We crossed a patch of talus and took a break to eat a snack while a marmot begged for food. Little guy was pretty hungry.</p>
<p>The ice axe and crampons came out for a snowfield to gain the ridge. We could have probably gotten away with just microspikes 
and trekking poles but it was fun to break out the snow gear. Once we gained the actual ridge the axe and crampons went back 
away since everything else was snow free.</p>

<p>The actual ridge was a complete blast. It was nice and consistent third and fourth class. The rock was absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>On the right side of the ridge, there was a straight cliff down to the snowfield below. The ridge crumbled to the left, and
any rock that fell that way prompted a small rock slide. Unfortunately, there were a couple times when we had to venture 
down to the left.</p>
<p>Luke and I found that the trick to travelling on the left side of the ridge was to stick to the microridges. The rock was still 
terrible there but at least it wouldnt slide down around your legs.</p>

<p>We stuck to the ridge proper whenever we could, and only deviated in a couple spots to bypass sketchy downclimb parts. One of 
the downclimbs we chose to bypass just due to the looseness of the rock.</p>
<p>We found a good snowfeild that we could get onto to help bypass the rock. However, in between us and the snowfeild was a 5 foot
gap resembling a bergschrund. To get across, we climbed up on a micro ridge, then dolphin dived across the bergschrund. That
saved us probably an hour of choss wrangling on the scree.</p>
<p>There was a pretty cool section as we were ending the ridge and approaching the summit. At first, there was a cool section of 
face climbing that was 4th maybe 5.1 climbing. Then, the ridge wrapped a little and went up another section of face.</p>

<p>I found a beak pounded into a crack showing that someone had chosen to protect that part before. They couldâ€™ve been doing the
climb in winter conditions I guess. I think anyone that knows to bring a beak would probably be competent enough to solo the
super easy climbing. I couldnt get the beak out to booty it.</p>

<p>We spent some time on the summit block before starting the descent.</p>
<p>The descent route we chose was to the west of the summit down the trail. The hike out kind of sucked since it was all covered 
in sun cupped snow.</p>
<p>We took a small detour and went straight to the highway then tried to hitch hike back to the car. Nobody picked us up so we got
to go on a nice little walk haha. We saw a roadkilled porcuipine on the way. I didnt know we had those in california.</p>
