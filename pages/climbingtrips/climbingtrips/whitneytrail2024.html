<p>We hadn't even been off the mountaineers route for an hour when Elaine suggested we should try the Mount Whitney Trail… Tomorrow.
Despite being semi worked from the past two days, I knew it'd be worth it to get back on the mountain. We agreed to celebrate 
new years eve and then re-discuss in the morning.</p>

<p>New years morning started with a beautifully put together mimosa 
brunch with Brede, Elaine, Jake, and Atalie. Total luxury. To add to the occasion, we drove up to the nearest hot springs 
and soaked for a while. While basking in the heat, we chatted about where we went wrong, and how to improve our next 
attempt. We floated the idea that since there was good weather for the next 48 hours, we should give the mountain another 
go. The main difference in the plan being that we would take the mount whitney trail instead of the mountaineers route.</p>

<p>In the summertime, the mount whitney trail is a highway to the summit, mainly for the “soft and succulent” as it was put
by John Muir. In the winter time, the trail is reduced to an 11 mile postholing slog (one way) requiring basic snow 
climbing skills. For that reason, anyone that is capable of the trail in winter conditions normally opts for the 
mountaineers route given the shorter and more engaging approach. I'm not too sure why we decided to do the trail but 
regardless it ended up being a blast.</p>

<p>What was initially a mimosa prompted idea quickly became a reality and once again we were driving up the whitney portal road 
to where we were just 2 days prior.</p>

<p>Our hike didn't start until way after dark. Anyone that spends a lot of time in the mountains knows that time doesn't really 
exist while on a “mission”. It's normal to start a hike at an ungodly hour, sometimes 1 or 2am, push for hours, sometimes 
take random naps in the dirt when convenient, things like that. Tonight was no different. I didn't even bother checking the 
time.</p>

<p>I knew I'd sleep when I could and get to the summit eventually.</p>

<p>For this attempt at the summit, we 
decided to do a few things differently. First, we brought one less tent, opting to squeeze 3 of us into a two person tent, 
ideally to conserve heat and also to save weight. Second, we chose to bring a 10L (yes 22 pounds) dromedary with us to 
Outpost Camp so we didn't need to waste any time messing around melting snow.</p>

<p>On the ascent to Outpost Camp, Elaine 
and I took turns carrying the drom. Once at camp we heated some water for our nalgenes and crawled into the tent for a 
couple hours of tossing and turning (but not freezing). It was decided that breakfast was going to be an on the move 
typa deal to save time.</p>

<p>At 4:45am the alarm went off and by 5:15 we were on the move.</p>

<p>Something inside of 
me decided that I wasn't about to spend another two days on Mount Whitney without a summit so I plowed ahead in 
the dark. Now before someone calls this impulsive and irresponsible, I'd like to make it known that we know when 
to turn back. We also know when to push responsibly to achieve our goals. This was one of those times.</p>

<p>The sun rose after I had been post holing for about 2 hours and reached Trail camp. At some point I had created a 
gap in between me and everyone else. They were nowhere to be seen. I continued on.</p>

<p>The infamous switchbacks after Trail Camp were probably my favorite part of the day. Snow had covered the switchbacks 
creating an engaging “obstacle course”. Where you had to traverse left and right, occasionally being able 
to cut straight up the switchbacks on snowfields. It would've been much easier and faster to climb the couloir on the right side of 
the switchbacks although I did not know this was here until I reached the top of the switchbacks. I was in the zone and only focused
on climbing up those things. Oops.</p>

<p>At Trailcrest I could see the rest of the group entering the switchbacks, using the trail I had broken about an hour earlier.</p>

<p>After trailcrest, I'll be honest in saying that the elevation got to me. The 2 miles from the crest to the summit were 
uneventful and would've been pretty boring had I not had my metal playlist playing at full blast. Nobody was around to hear my 
obnoxious music so it was all fun. The views west were spectacular. As I neared the summit the winds were picking up and I was 
getting quite tired.</p>

<p>I ran into the summit hut with the urgency of needing one item from the grocery store and knowing 
exactly where to find it. When I tried to drink from my bottle, it was frozen solid. Shoot. Luckily my other bottle had not 
frozen all the way as it was on the inside of my backpack. Phew. In the process i accidentally spilled some water on my 
glasses which promptly froze so those went back in the pack.</p>

<p>I taped up my pants where I accidentally ripped them with my crampon.</p>

<p>Then I scribbled my name in the summit registry and snapped a couple not so scenic photos of 
the summit before charging downwards. I had submitted over an hour past my initial decided turnaround time. Rookie 
mistakes I know, especially as the weather I had known about prior continued to grow. The two miles back to trail 
crest were fast now that I had broken the trail.</p>

<p>In the snow, I could see markings of an ice axe that 
wasn't mine, so I knew that my friends had at least made it to trail crest (a little past that actually) before 
turning back. As the weather kept growing, I felt a sense of uneasiness that wouldn't subside until I met back 
up with everyone. At this point, I remembered the couloir to the right of the switchbacks. Epic! Initially, I 
planned to downclimb the couloir but after testing the conditions it became evident that it'd be way more fun 
to just glissade.</p>

<p>Upon coming to a nice stop 1000 feet down the couloir, I turned and saw everyone on the switchbacks! We let out some hoots and 
hollers in relief that we were finally reunited almost 10 
hours after initially getting split up.</p>

<p>I waited for them at the bottom of the switchbacks and we hiked back to outpost camp and then out to the car. I think we got 
to the car at 10:30.</p>

<p>Now after a full day of postholing, most of that breaking fresh trail, and snow climbing, i was
pretty worked and fell asleep almost immediately after desuiting and getting in the car.</p>

<p>The next day was a total self care day and we spent it at a cafe and some hot springs in some typical eastside fashion.
