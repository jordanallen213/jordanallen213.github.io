<p>This trip is a difficult one to write about. Wait, that makes it sound bad. It was a phenomenal trip. I couldn’t have had a better time. There were great friends, great views, and great times. The part that makes it difficult to write about is that it was all over the place.</p>
<p>The original plan was to attempt Mount Rainier with my friends Jake and Brede. We had been doing lots of research on glacier travel and crevasse rescue and felt pretty confident. The only issue was that there was a storm blowing into the PNW.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless of if we got to get on a mountain or not, I still wanted to spend some time with the homies. And with that, I got on the red eye train from Davis to Klamath Falls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not sleep that night. I probably could have if I had tried to relax a bit harder. It was no use though as I was glued to the window- watching the upper Sacramento river while the sun rose.</p>
<p>I got to Oregon in the morning and was greeted by Jake, Elaine, and Brede. The stoke was high and it was just nice to be in some good company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the apartment, we ate a nice breakfast before discussing a game plan. At this point, it looked like the weather on Rainier would not allow for a summit attempt. We decided that it wouldnt be worth driving all the way up from Oregon if we were just going to be stuck at Camp Muir for a few days.</p>
<p>With that in mind, we turned our sights south to Shasta. If we left right away we could make a nice weather window and attempt the Casaval Ridge before the storm blew in the next afternoon. And we were off.</p>
<p>I had never been to the Bunny Flats trailhead before, so it was cool to see what all the hype was about. Avalanche Gulch also looked pretty epic in the front and center.</p>
<p>I dont remember when exactly we started our approach but it was definitely in the afternoon. Probably 3 or 4 pm. The snow was very soft and made for rough postholing conditions.</p>
<p>Just before sunset we picked out a spot at around 9500-10k feet that didnt have snow and would be perfect for camp. Brede boiled water while Jake and I set up the camp and got gear ready for the morning.At 1am we awoke and had a quick coffee and breakfast before setting off into the dark. As we ascended the ridge the conditions only got windier and colder. Once we gained the ridge proper, we decided to break out the rope, since we couldnt see what the fall risk was and the snow was very firm. Plus, we wanted practice using a running belay.</p>

<p>There were many moments where the wind was so strong that it blinded you with chunks of ice being flung in your face. It was windy enough that we resorted to wearing our sunglasses, even though it was still pitch black. We continued along the ridge until about sunrise.</p>


<p>At this point, I could see that the terrain we were in was not as severe as it had seemed in the darkness. Additionally, I was getting very cold (I'm blaming my lack of sleep). In fact, I was even colder than when we did mount whitney- and I was even wearing more layers this time! Given that it was only going to get colder and windier as we ascended, and I’ve already summited shasta before, I decided to turn back. I was comfortable going back unroped on the terrain which made the decision a lot easier.</p>

<p>Brede and Jake also decided to turn around with me, however they definitely should have kept going for the summit. I felt bad that they decidedto join me on my retreat. I ended up getting back to camp a while before them and took a nap while waiting. Once they got back, we started packing up camp and listened to some music.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of glissading and a nice little hike, we were back at the car. Although we didn’t summit, it was still very fun. I learned my lesson that I need a full night of sleep before doing things like that. I honestly believe that the lack of sleep and exhaustion from the train and camp caused me to have issues maintaining my body heat. Other than that, the trip was great.</p>
<p>It was super nice to spend some time with the homies before we head our separate ways for the summer. There's talks of linking up in Alaska again- I'm hyped. I took the train back to Davis that night and was back by the next morning.</p>
