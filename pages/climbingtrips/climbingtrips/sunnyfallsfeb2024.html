<p>This time when Jake and I went to Eagle lake we went earlier and were at the trailhead by 7am. Right as we were leaving the 
    trailhead to eagle lake, Jake and I crossed paths with some climbers that were hiking out from an epic they had on one of the 
    nearby peaks. Seemed really cold but they were still pretty stoked.</p>
<p>We skied up to the lake and across it. The trail wouldve been easy to walk up since it was so packed but we needed the skis for 
    later. Right before the turnoff to Eagle lake there was some avalanche debris that came down from Maggies and swept across the 
    trail.</p>
<p>Avy danger for the day was 2 above treeline and 1 below so it was really chill. We brought shovels regardless.Skiing across the
     lake was one of my favorite parts of the day, being so wide open and scenic.</p>
<p>The ice climbs on the south side of the lake were completely snowed over and we didnt really want to go tunnelling for something 
    to climb so we skied into the canyon. Bushwacking alders is already difficult. With skis on its another beast.</p>
<p>As we headed west we trended uphill through the snowbrdges barely covering the boulder field.</p>
<p>Eventually we found sunny falls. We had next to no knowledge of the climbs except for “sunny falls is up the canyon from eagle
     lake”. It was pretty obvious. The ice wasnt very well developed and it had been warm lately. Today it was a high of 34 I 
     think? </p>

     <p>There was one line that we were able to top rope from a tree. I need to remember to bring some static rope for a TR 
     anchor though if i go back. The ice was good until the top part where it turned to dense snow on some rock. Some 
     beached-whaling gets you to the top. I think the line is like WI3, it wasnt hard.</p>
     
     <p>We left once the air started heating up and things were melting off.</p>

        <p>We didnt ski through the boulders on the way back but postholed through the alders and the thigh deep
      snow. It was quicker since we werent having to be as careful on the snow bridges. Then we skied across the lake and down to 
      the car.</p>
