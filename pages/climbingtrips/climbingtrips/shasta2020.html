    <p>Matt, Joe, Jacob and I did this trip back in 2020 after graduating from highschool. I believe the motivation for it was that we couldn't get Whitney permits and this was what we deemed to be the next best thing.</p>
    <p>Some details about this trip are pretty fuzzy since it happened three years ago.</p>
    <p>What I do remember though is that we were supposed to do the Avalanche Gulch route until the day of the trip. At the gear shop they told us not to take that route and that they advised against attempting shasta at all since there was so much loose rock. They said that if we must get on the mountain then to take the clear creek route. I think they just saw a bunch of kids and assumed we wouldn't be able to summit.</p>
    <p>Clear creek is the easiest route up the mountain, hence being sent there i guess.</p>
    <p>We were able to make good time up the first couple thousand feet. It was really nice being able to fill up our water bottles at the spring halfway into the hike. We gained the ridge at about 10k feet and made our camp.</p>
    <p>Looking back on this, I guess we started on the clear creek route and managed to make our way over to the Wintun Ridge route. Technically that's just a variation of clear creek i guess.</p>
    <p>Anyway it was also really cool witnessing the pyramid shaped shadow cast by shasta as the sun set.</p>

        <figcaption>Our camp at about 10k feet on the Wintun Ridge.</figcaption>

    <p>We woke up at 1am after a couple hours of rolling around and then got our stuff packed up. Jacob and I were armed with microspikes and hiking boots while Matt and Joe had more appropriate boots and crampons. At least we all had ice axes for the snow fields.</p>
    <p>We filled up some more water running off one of the snow fields.</p>
    <p>Before the sun rose we were able to see the Neowise comet with our naked eyes which was super cool. A phone camera couldn't get a photo unfortunately.</p>
    <p>At the time of this trip, I think Jacob was doing a lot of bike racing or something. Regardless, he was in much better shape than we were and would gain a ton of distance on us and then take naps while he waited.</p>
    <p>After reaching the summit plateau I dropped my pack and just brought some water up to the top. The summit was pretty cool although the elevation was kicking my ass. This was the first time I had ever been above 10 thousand feet before, and we kind of did this off the couch.&nbsp;</p>

    <p>Anyway the summit was cool. We hung out there for about an hour and took some photos and such.</p>
    <p>We met a guy up there in tennis shoes and microspikes who said he came up avy gulch. He brought his skis up as well. I was pretty pissed that the shop told us not to go that way because it sounded epic haha.</p>
    <p>The descent was my favorite part. Thousands of feet of glissading and scree skiing down to camp. Then, we hightailed it to the in n out in redding. Overall, I remember this being a pretty fun trip. Iâ€™ll be back again.</p>
