<p>The ice is there- barely- but it's there.</p>
<p>We got a pretty late start up to the lake, not leaving the lot until 9:15am. There wasnt any parking issues yet which kind 
of surprised me. The trail was hardpacked snow and went fast.</p>
<p>At 10am we made it to Eagle Lake, which was nearly all the way frozen over except for the outlet.</p>
<p>Some ice on the walls across the lake was visible so we headed straight there.</p>

<p>Before walking across the lake we chopped a hole in the ice to check the thickness. It was thick enough,
allowing us to walk straight across the lake instead of taking the southern shoreline.</p>

<p>The ice was clearly melting fast and wasnâ€™t in good condition for a lead. Instead, we opted to hike up to the left of the 
cliffs, then set up a top rope and rappelled down to the base.</p>
<p>The climbing was wet. Derek even brought his swim goggles in preparation. We each got a couple 
laps in. By 2pm the ice was noticeably melting off so we called it a day.</p>
<p>It looked like there could have been some more climbs up the canyon on both the north and south walls but we didnt really 
check. The ice was pretty sparse all in all.</p>
