    <p>The first part of this trip was a blur. I was working as a line cook at the time and had just gotten off a 10 hour 
        shift. 6am to 4pm. I drove home, loaded all my gear into the car, then hit the road south. My Subaru overheated 
        before I even left town and I had to stop by Target to get more coolant and whatnot. I remember about 8 hours into 
        the drive I was popping Excedrin to stay awake. I made it to J tree eventually.</p>
        
        <p>I'm not sure exactly where i slept that night but i'll tell you that wherever it was, it probably wasn't legal. 
            That's alright though, because I woke up at sunrise to go site hunting in hidden valley. Luckily, some people were 
            on their way out and I was able to snag their spot.</p>
        
        
        <p>Not much more can be said for this trip. I had some homies pull up and we spent the next few days climbing and hanging 
            out. We weren't extra motivated and only climbed a few pitches a day but it was still a blast.</p>

        <p>I remember texting my boss off my garmin inreach that i wasn't coming into work.</p>
        <p>We made it up into the space station to play some guitar and hangout.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>It's always pretty fun in the hidden valley campground, I'm just bummed I missed the NYE party.</p>
