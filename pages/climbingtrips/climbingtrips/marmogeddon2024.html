<p>This trip was a fun one I did with my friend and climbing partner Ian. We drove up to desolation on Friday afternoon after class and slept on the side of Wrights Lake Road. The next day we hiked into the cirque at the base of pyramid peak and set up camp. In the afternoon we shuttled our rack up a moderate snow pitch and stashed it on a rock island. </p>
<p>The next morning we set off up the moderate snow pitch again which proved to be more challenging in ice conditions. The next snow pitch topped out at about 60 degrees and was interesting in hiking boots. I soloed the pitch then belayed Ian up with the rope I trailed behind me.</p>

<p>After this, I led the next rock pitch which went at about 5.8 with a pack on. It was a pretty nice finger crack in a left facing dihedral. The pitch ended with some loose rock and a belay on a sandy ledge. </p>
<p>Ian led the next pitch up some blocks and into a cool mantle move. He followed the 4th class blocks until a nice block about 20 feet west of Pyramidâ€™s true summit. As he belayed me up, a marmot kept trying to chew the slings on the anchor hence the name Marmogeddon.</p>

<p>We descended down the north ridge back to our camp and had some wine. In the morning we left and made good time back to the car.</p>

<p>All said and done, the route we are calling Marmogeddon goes at 5.8 Steep Snow and is 4 pitches with a 70 meter rope. Two pitches of snow and then two of rock. There's a possibility that it has been done before, but most likely not as a snow climb. Once the snow melts off, there could potentially be an additional pitch of rock to be climbed. Regardless, if you or someone you know has climbed this route, please email me and let me know! </p>
