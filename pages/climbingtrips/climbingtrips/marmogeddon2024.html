<p>Two years ago while doing the Crystal Range Traverse, I caught my first glimpses of the North West Face of Pyramid Peak. Having summited the peak a handful of times, I was pretty surprised to see that the mostly talus-composed mountain actually contained some terrain steep enough to hold technical climbing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next year, I did a handful of hikes up to the cirque at the base of Pyramid to practice my snow climbing in the north facing snowfields. These trips gave me an opportunity to scout routes on the face. I was aware of a few routes done in the 80’s, but honestly it was hard to pinpoint them as the existing route descriptions were very vague. I decided that I wanted to do a route on the face of the peak, as it would complete my idea of doing “all” the routes up the peak. “All” being all the major routes like the north ridge, east face, south ridge, south west ridge, and now north west face.</p>
<p>I was able to come up with a trip plan- the proposed route, the approach, the descent logistics- the only thing i needed was a partner to make an attempt on the face. Eventually, I was able to recruit my friend and climbing partner, Ian, to come out and attempt to climb the peak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trip would involve travelling just over 6 miles to our base camp in the cirque below the mountain. Due to the time of year, we would also have to deal with snowy conditions, making both travelling and packing more difficult. With our winter gear, regular backpacking gear, and climbing gear, both our packs weighed about 60 pounds and were loaded to the brims.</p>
<p>We drove up to desolation on the evening of friday night and ate dinner then slept on the side of the road. We werent particularly in a rush since we had a full day ahead of us to travel only 6 miles. We woke up at around 7 without any alarms set. Apparently, the night was foggy, as both our tents and sleeping bags were pretty soaked. Great way to start the trip! Luckily, everything dried out as we ate breakfast and relaxed.</p>
<p>By 9am we started our hike. Surprisingly enough, we made pretty good time up to camp. Despite our amount of gear, the snow, our many breaks, and the elevation gain, it only took us about 3 hours to get to the cirque.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our first chore was building snow walls around our campsite- both to flatten out the area and to protect from wind. From my prior trips to the cirque, I knew that the cirque gets really windy. The snow walls were very important, especially later in the trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given that our camp was at 9000 feet, and my body was only acclimated to 60 feet from the valley, even digging the snow walls completely wiped me out. We took a nice long break after camp was set up before setting out for the afternoon.</p>
<p>At around 4pm we decided to shuttle our rack up to the base of the climb so we didnt have to in the morning. We stashed the rack at the last rocks exposed below the final snow field. We then continued up a steep snow field to the base of the north west face. The snow was pretty soft at this time of day, which made the unroped climbing manageable. The slope topped out a little steeper than 60 degrees as can be seen in a few of the photos.</p>

    </figure>
<p>The descent of the steep snow went really smoothly, as our foot holes were pretty kicked in and established. We were walking down the moderate snow field when I accidentally took a slip. My feet managed to just fly out from under me, perhaps unsurprisingly given the lack of crampons. Next thing I knew, I was sliding towards the rocks below me. Everyone has practiced self arresting, but not too many people have had to use the technique. Anyway, I was fine and it was only sort of a close call.</p>
<p>Back at camp, we made some dinner and rested for the next day. The clouds rolled in as the wind picked up, putting our snow walls to use.</p>
<p>As per theme for the trip, we had a pretty chill morning. Additionally, the snow was frozen into ice which prevented us from leaving camp early. Around 10am we started our ascent up the rock slabs to the snow.&nbsp;</p>

    </figure>
<p>The snow that was soft yesterday proved to be challenging in ice conditions. Especially since we did not have any crampons with us (rookie mistake).&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be safe, we decided to rope up. I led off with the rope and both tools to the next exposed rocks. The slope was only about 45 degrees but was difficult in the current conditions. I made an anchor then ziplined the tools down to Ian so he could climb up with a belay.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to the second pitch of snow, which was known to be steep. I like swinging tools and knew that would be the best move for traveling up the snow/ice. Leading off (soloing with a rope attached is a better description), I quickly discovered that if we had not kicked in the steps the day prior, it would be impassable without crampons. Luckily, I was able to make short work of the pitch due to our ladder we made and also having 2 tools. I built an anchor in the randkluft, just below the start of our route.</p>
<p>Ian made his way up with only one axe due to a rookie ziplining mistake I won't elaborate too much on…</p>
<p>The rock pitch I led was killer. It was a tight finger crack in a dihedral that required a tad bit of gardening. For the most part it was cruiser, and went at about 5.8. The pitch ended with navigation through some death blocks before reaching a perfect belay ledge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ian led the next pitch that trended left up a tight hand crack onto the top of a flake. A pretty committing and sick 5.8 mantle move granted access to some 4th and 3rd class blocks above. He continued up the blocks until reaching a block 20’ west from the summit. While I was belaying Ian, I got whizzed by a few rocks and even had one shatter on my belay ledge. Due to the traversing nature of the pitch, I could tell that Ian didnt send the rocks down. It could have been the marmots above.</p>
<p>Communication was nonexistent and not possible from the ledge to the summit just due to the wind and nature of the pitch. So when the rope reached the end, I started climbing, unsure if we were simul climbing or if i was on belay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon reaching the final block, I saw I was in fact on belay off a full 3 piece anchor. Bomber. I was then informed that the marmots on the peak had been chewing on said anchor. Less bomber. That's what gives this climb the name Marmodeggon.</p>

    </figure>
<p>We spent a couple of minutes hanging out on the peak and changing back into wet boots. Meanwhile the marmots surrounded us, eager to earn a bite to eat (and not getting one).</p>
<p>Given we no longer had access to one of our ice tools and couldnt downclimb our original descent plan, we opted to descend the North Ridge, following the Crystal Range Traverse. This descent was much more scenic and I'm glad we did it. It was cool to easily descend a route that had once been a challenge for me to ascend. It brought a sense of accomplishment and growth.</p>
<p>After a quick detour to retrieve the lost ice tool, we got to boot ski/glissade back to camp where we celebrated with some wine and chocolate. The wind picked up again and we went to bed as the sun set.</p>
<p>Waking up, lounging, and packing was a slow process. We really didnt have anywhere to be, so we took our time. Plus, waiting for the sun to heat the snow would allow for glissading. The hike out was really pleasant and we got to see tons of brook trout in Lyons Creek.</p>
<p>All said and done, the route we are calling Marmogeddon goes at 5.8 Steep Snow and is 4 pitches with a 70 meter rope. Two pitches of snow and then two of rock. There's a possibility that it has been done before, but most likely not as a snow climb. Once the snow melts off, there could potentially be an additional pitch of rock to be climbed. Regardless, if you or someone you know has climbed this route, please email me and let me know! I think my next mission out to the north west face will be as a day trip. I think itll be doable in a long day if I get in good shape!</p>
