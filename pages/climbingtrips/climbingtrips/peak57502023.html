<p>It's a lot easier to travel over a bog when it's covered in snow.</p>
<p>For that reason, when I saw snow on the forecast, I pestered Trinidad to take the day off. The next morning, we awoke to snow 
capped mountains to our south. There wasn't too much of a plan for the day, other than going into the hills and bagging a peak 
or two depending on time.</p>
<p>We spent a majority of the morning in the van making a trip to cantwell to get some gas and redbull. The discussion revolved
around the ethics of publishing climbing routes. I say keep it adventurous.</p>
<p>Our hike started on frozen ground. Not snow covered but frozen from the night before.</p>
<p>There were a few ptarmigan on the trail. If you've ever come across one of these birds, you'd know that they aren't exactly the 
smartest animal in the forest. Despite their lack of intelligence, we still could not catch one. Even with a flying ice axe. 
No ptarmigan for dinner that's alright.</p>
<p>The first half of our hike took us East a couple miles on a hunting trail. Apparently horses will deeply washboard a trail if 
the conditions are muddy enough. The trail we took is mainly used by moose hunters in the fall and dog sledders in the winter.
Not too many other people use it or even know it exists.</p>
<p>We turned south at a creek and traveled into the forest. Bushwhacking in Alaska is pokey, wet, and dense. It's a constant 
struggle, but you grow to appreciate it, and eventually miss it when it's gone. This bushwack took us through a black spruce 
forest on the edge of a bog. We just headed in whatever way gained the most elevation, not caring for heading in the correct 
direction. We figured that once we were above the treeline we could head towards the peak.</p>
<p>Above the treeline, there was a brief section of willow shrubs and blueberry bushes. The blueberries were frozen from the night 
before and made a delicious treat. Finally, we reached the snowline and travel became much faster.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, we reached the top of the ridge that separated us from Peak 5750. The homies back at camp could see us through 
binoculars, a couple miles away.</p>
<p>About at this point, I started getting a migraine and couldn't see the best so I stuck Trinidad in the front and had him lead 
the way. The migraine wore off, thankfully, before I had to hop across a frozen creek. You kinda have to see for that.</p>
<p>The elevation really picked up here as we started up Peak 5750. We had two ridges to choose from, the left ridge and the right 
ridge we’ll call them. They both joined up with the main ridge so it doesn't really matter which we chose. The right ridge was 
right in front of us so we chose that one.</p>
<p>Hiking up the ridge wasn't particularly difficult, but it was challenging. There was loose talus that had about 4-6 inches of 
fresh snow on top of it. This created a unique problem where when you stepped anywhere, you wouldn't really know if your foot 
would go through the snow and get twisted on the rocks. It was fine and this terrain didn't last very long.</p>
<p>We also hiked up this face that worried both Trinidad and I due to avalanche concerns. We determined that only one of us would 
travel through here at a time. That way, if it avalanched, only one of us would get swept off the cliffs below. The snow
conditions were pretty prime but the chance of avy is never 0.</p>

    </figure>
<p>We continued south on the ridge, over some crusts in the snow and then through some pockets of wind deposited powder. The views 
up here were utterly insane. All the mountains around us were perfectly coated in snow that dissipated at the base. To our left
was the Revine Creek watershed. To our right we could see the beginnings of the Slime Creek drainage.</p>

        </figure>
<p>There was a cool third class spire in the middle of the ridge that was covered in rime ice. We could have traversed around the 
spire/block but it was much more fun to go over it. A short walk from here brought us to the summit.</p>


<p>The summit had probably the best view I had seen all summer. Probably one of the best views I've seen in my life. Check out the 
photos and you'll understand why. We spent about half an hour up there before heading down.</p>

    </figure>
<p>The summit is only halfway.</p>
<p>The descent went smooth and didn't really get difficult until we dropped below the snowline. At the ridge that we could see 
from camp, we decided to head straight north to pick up our trail. That way, we could shorten the amount of bushwhacking and 
could avoid a creek. What we did not anticipate, but should've, was the series of bogs in between us and the trail.</p>
<p>It's hard to stay motivated to stay dry when you're already tired and damp. Not going to lie, I just walked through a good 
amount of the bog and got soaked and muddy beyond belief. Three quarters of the way through the trip both Trinidad and I were
pretty beat. We sat down for a break and he whipped out a monstrous handful of fruit snacks from his pack. Luxury dinner.</p>
<p>It was tough for me to get going again and Trinidad commented on my endurance. He said it was funny that I can move for hours,
all day even, but once I stop it's damn near impossible to get me going again. I mean it makes sense though i get tired!</p>
<p>Anyway the trip back was mainly just a muddy slog on the melted out hunting trail. At some point, we took a wrong turn and 
ended up on the road with the van nowhere in sight. Like all good trips, we had to walk for about a mile on the side of highway
3 before finding the van. Seems to be a common theme. I wonder what the tourists thought of two disheveled guys, covered in 
mud, with ice axes, walking down the side of the highway in the middle of alaska.</p>
<p>In total the trip was 14 miles with about 4k gain. I think it took about 7 hours? The descent took less than 3 hours as per
strava.</p>
