        <h1>Fly Fishing</h1>


<p>I started fishing when I was just a youngin'. As most do, I started fishing with a spinning rod and reel, focusing on catching bass and bluegill in the local ponds.
    It wasnt until 2017 that I picked up my first fly rod. I haven't been much of a spin fisherman since. 
</p>
<p>Trout are more rewarding for me to catch than any other type of fish out there. It's crazy how detail oriented they can be to the flies that fisherman use.
    Trout tend to live in some of the prettiest places too, which means each outing is going to feel rewarding- fish or no fish.
    Before I started climbing, fishing was my go to activity. I still fish, but not with the devotion that I used to. 
</p>
<p>
I have hundreds of photos of the fish I've caught. Most fisherman do. Most of them are pretty boring though, so I wont include them on the page.
Additionally, I've decided to sort the page by year, so I can update each page with cool catches as the time progresses. I will say that 2021 will probably
have the most entertaining photos as thats when I was fishing the most.
</p>
