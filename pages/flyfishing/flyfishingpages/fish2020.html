<h1>2020 Fishing Report</h1>

<p>Looking back on it, I did a bunch of fishing back in 2020. I fished Montana, Idaho, Northern California, Southern California, and a
     bunch of my home waters in the Tahoe area. I fished so much that year that I even caught the same fish twice, weeks apart (I'm not kidding). 
I would say that 2020 is when fly fishing really clicked for me. As covid gave me a ton of time to practice.
</p>

    Above, you can see two photos of the SAME fish. If you dont believe me, zoom in on the cheek and match the dots. I made the photos
     clickable so you can open full sized ones easily. The photo on the left was taken in June, and the photo on the right was taken later that summer in July.
      This fish was caught in a really small body of water in the tahoe area (secret sorry). The catches were about 0.3 miles away from eachother. Anyway, I just thought that was crazy.
</p>

<p>
    In 2020 I also caught my first ever brook trout in California. I found it in the West Fork of the Carson River. We found a bunch of them
     that day as they were pretty hungry for the dry flies we had.

<p>
    I think the highlights of 2020 fishingwise were probably from the trips that I did. One of the trips I did was a road trip of California
     that I did with my cousin. I did a little fishing on this trip. In the McCloud, I was able to catch a few brook trout (not pictured). Down in
      SoCal, I fished a small creek near the Mount Whitney Portal. I was able to get an interestingly patterned brown trout. This was 4 years ago and I still remember it very vividly.

<p>
    Lets see. The next trip I went on I think was a backpacking trip through the sawtooth mountains in Idaho. That trip could have a trip report of its own.
     We pretty much just fished all day while hiking. Probably got 20 fish a day while just casually testing the waters. I'll put a few cool ones down below. Go ahead and click on them for a full sized image.

    After the sawtooths, I took some time off of fishing to do a trip on mount shasta, which you can read about <a href="https://altitudeaddict.com/pages/climbingtrips/climbingtrips/shasta2020.html">here</a>. The 
    summer was young though and I still had time to go do some more trips. I went on a day hike/fish with my mom out to another secretish creek in the tahoe area. 
    I got this cool brook trout too that can be seen below.

<p>
    Then, in September, me and my friends did a roadtrip to the Gallatin river near Bozeman, Montana. We slept in the car for a week parked on forest service roads.
     It was pretty fun and we got a ton of fish. These ones are also clickable to see full sized photos.

    In september is also when I moved to Davis. It was then that I turned my sights to Putah Creek. Putah Creek is known for being a difficult fishery. 
    It probably took me 4 trips before catching anything. Lo and behold: my first ever putah creek fish. Even though this one is small- the creek holds some BIG fish. Check out the 2021 page.
