<h1>2021 Fishing Report</h1>
<p>2021 was the year of big fish. Mainly from putah creek. Apart from there, I also fished the Yuba river pretty frequently. I even got out
     to Utah to fish the Provo river and up to Humboldt to get a coastal cutthroat. Oh, I also went steelhead fishing on the Feather
      river for the first and only time ever. I caught one on my first cast of the day which kind of ruined the whole concept of "fish of a thousand casts" for me.
      Down below you can see them.

    My experience at Putah Creek began with catching a ton of short but thick fish. Its funny how short they'll be while still maintaining 
    a healthy tummy. These guys are going to grow big. I was fishing the creek very frequently, normally 3-4 times a week. 
    At one point, I had it down a science, and it was unusual to leave without catching 10-15 fish in a few hours. Those days are gone though as the waters change every year 
    and I'm no longer as in touch with the creek.

    As mentioned above, I made it up to Northern California and got a couple coastal cutthroat trout. Here's one of them below. Small, but a fish is a fish.

<p>
    When I wasn't fishing Putah Creek, I would often hit the Yuba. The only issues with the Yuba were that it was an hour and a half away 
    and it required us to wake up early. Regardless, we still got out there often for some decent fish.

    Here are the best fish from that Provo trip I mentioned. That trip was really interesting. On one day of fishing we each caught about 14 fish each. But then on the next day,
     we got the skunk. I dont know what happened.

    Alright, y'all have been patient to see the big ones from Putah. While I was fishing 3-4 times a week, developing a fail-safe 
    fish catching method, I stumbled upon a couple secret techniques. I won't elaborate on them here, but lets just say they improved 
    our fishing game immensly. After that, a large 18-20+ inch trout was nearly guarenteed on every outing. Here are a few of them. In the 
    bottom middle photo oyu can see one of the bigger fish I've caught at the creek. You can click on them to bring up full sized photos.
