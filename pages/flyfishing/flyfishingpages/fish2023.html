<h1>2023 Fishing Report</h1>

<p> I hardly did any fishing in 2023. In fact, the only fish I caught were in the summer while I was living in Alaska. I caught an absolute ton 
    of arctic grayling in the creeks near camp. I was also able to find some good rainbows and possibly a steelhead in a tributary to the Chulitna river. I say possibly 
    because I didn't land it. The creek I was fishing saw really small. I could jump across it in some parts. There's no way a 20inch fish in there isn't a steelhead. Especially 
    when you can see all the salmon migrating up the creek to spawn too. Anyway, here are some grayling I caught. I don't have too many photos of them, since I wouldnt really bring my phone with me. 
    It rains a lot in Alaska, and theres no service, so bringing the phone doesn't do much and often leads to wet electronics.
