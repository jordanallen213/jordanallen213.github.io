<h1>2024 Fishing Report</h1>

    I've been hitting Putah Creek pretty regularly this month. I've been trying to maximize my time with my firends while we are still living 
    in Davis. Anyway, turns out we still got it. Here's a good trout from the other day. Both me and Eli landed good fish about 5 minutes apart then just called it good and went home.

    I'm going to periodically update this when I do some more fishing. I've been hard at work tying up flies for the grayling in Denali.

    Went out to fish a small creek in the Crystal Range while on a lovely backpacking trip with my girlfriend. We caught plenty of hungry rainbows, a brown, and a little brook as well.
     A Crystal Range hat trick!

<p>Finally got into some grayling while up here living in Denali. Sam and I hooked about 20 of these lil guys on dries in about 2 hours. The fish were going nuts for some mayflies I had tied while down in California.
    They are mainly made out of some turkey feathers that my friend Eli gave to me. The turkey has a nice natural color taper that I think appears nicely in the body of a fly. I'll have to remember to tie a bunch more this upcoming offseason as the ones I tied recently are going fast.

    I got out for some more grayling today with my friend Derek. We had a quick trip given it was pouring rain. It only took about 5 minutes 
    for each of us to get a fish big enough for a substantial meal. We hiked back to the road and had lunch underneath the shelter of a small bridge. That was that.
