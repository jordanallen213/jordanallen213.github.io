<h1>2022 Fishing Report</h1>
<p>
    I'm not going to lie, I didn't do very much fishing in 2022. I went on another road trip to Montana, although most of our time there was 
    spent climbing. It was this year that my fishing momentum really slowed down. I had begun climbing and that took a large 
    majority of my time. I forget what river this was on but I was able to whip up a couple of cutthroat and some whitefish. You can 
    tell that cimbing really took over given by the fact that I can't remember the name of the river. Oh well.

    I did make it out to the Yuba too. On this trip I caught one of my biggest trout ever. I remember freaking out as he tore downstream, given 
    that I was fishing with 5x line. My friend Eli ran downstream to net it once he saw the size of it. It was caught on a top secret fly Eli 
    has been tying. After this fish, I hung the fly on my wall and haven't used it since. I haven't really fished the Yuba either since. 
    We have tried once or twice and got skunked. Getting skunked is rough after catching a fish like this one.

    I did of course hit Putah Creek a couple of times as well. We caught some pretty good fish there as normal. I dont have any of those 
    on here though. You can check the <a href="file:///C:/Users/jorda/Documents/GitHub/jordanallen213.github.io/pages/flyfishing/flyfishingpages/fish2021.html">

    </a> though if you want to see some big Putah Creek fish.
