<p>The goal of this trip was to a) go to the arctic circle and b) ski (and snowboard) in the arctic circle. Spenny, Dylan, and I left on wednesday after half a day of dilly dallying and made our way up. Around fairbanks we realized we would have to stop and get food for our trip. To cut down on time we decided to get all of our food at Taco Bell.</p>
<p>Bean and cheese burritos (with rice) contain all the macronutrients needed to keep a body going in the backcountry. Protein, fat, and carbs- all rolled into a single tortilla- a caloric masterpiece. Not to mention they probably have enough preservatives in them to keep them fresh after a couple of days in the car. We got 50 of them figuring that should be enough for a few days.</p>
<p>After fuelling up (on gas and burritos) we were off to the arctic circle on the Dalton Highway.</p>
<p>It took us about 9 burritos to make it to the sign that said we had officially entered the arctic circle.</p>
<p>11 burritos in we had made it to coldfoot to buy some $8/gallon gas.</p>
<p>Around 6am I awoke in the driver's seat of the car, camped on the side of the road. At this point we ate burrito 12 and 13 then continued on to Deadhorse. We figured it was only 80 miles north and worth a stop to get coffee.</p>
<p>Deadhorse reminds me of an industrial moon camp. Gray, dusty, flat, and dead yet productive. The coffee was bland and worked well.</p>
<p>It took us until 16 burritos were consumed to leave and head back towards Atigun pass.</p>
<p>18 burritos in, our windshield was assaulted by a flying rock which earned it a nice scar.</p>
<p>On the drive south it was pretty cool to see some musk ox along the road. They were chill and didnt mind us very much.</p>

<p>The next morning we headed up to the pass in search of snow which was easily found in the basin north of Peak 6370. I lost track of our burrito count here as we were occupied with other endevors. </p>
<p>The hike was pretty chill. It gained about 2500 feet over a few miles. The snow ranged from a dusting to a foot or so at the top of the ridge. Even though there was some snow, there was still an abundance of rocks to be seen.</p>
<p>The summit of Peak 6370 was pretty cool. It was pretty skinny and had good exposure to the north and a nice rocky slope on the south. We descended the east ridge to a saddle, skiing (and snowboarding) on some light wind deposit snow. That was probably my favorite bit of skiing.</p>
<p>We also skiied the bowl to the north of the peak. That snow was mainly crust and avy debris- making for some interesting survival skiing on my part. Spenny and Dylan cruised it. We also had a third mini pitch of skiing in which I earned myself a new pair of rock skis. Totally worth it.</p>
<p>After that we hiked out and spent the night in the Volvo again, parked on the side of Atigun pass. The lights came out too. That was cool.</p>
<p>47 bean and cheese burritos later we rolled back into camp. Happy, healthy, and full.</p>
