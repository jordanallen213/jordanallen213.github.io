<p>Like all good trips, this one was planned less than 24 hours in advance. Kevin texted me and proposed the idea of heading to the 
    valley since we both had a 3 day weekend. Someone had the idea of climbing The Prow on Washington Column, it could have been me
     or him. Obviously we were both game and that was the extent of the planning.</p>
<p>After my last class of the day, and after hitting trader joes to stock up on lentils and wine, I was on the road. The drive went
     fast and before I knew it I was driving through the valley gawking at el cap and the surrounding walls.</p>
<p>Kevin and I met up in the parking lot of Curry Village to start organizing our gear. For this climb we were pretty much going to
     have to bring all of the gear we owned. We weren't exactly trying to go light so a lot of extra gear was brought along.</p>
<p>After assembling our massive rack of gear and loading it into the car, we drove over to the Ahwahnee and dropped it on the side 
    of the approach trail. I stayed with the gear as Kevin drove the car to one of the parking lots and skateboarded back. It was
     probably 9pm at this point and already dark.</p>
<p>The next 5 hours involved many trips back and forth to shuttle our probably 100-150 lbs of stuff to the base of the wall. We had
     to take multiple trips since we only had one haul bag and obviously when it was filled it was way too heavy to carry. I think
      it would be way smarter to shuttle the gear in backpacking backpacks that are meant to carry heavy loads. Then just load 
      everything into the haul bags at the base.</p>
<p>One trip I carried our rack of gear while Kevin carried the ropes and more gear. We did another trip where I carried the water 
    clipped to slings over my shoulders. Kevin carried the portaledge and the rest of the gear. When the trail got really steep and
     scrambly, we had to take 3 or even 4 trips.</p>
<p>There were already some packs at the base of the route so we knew it was about to be a busy weekend. It was at this point that
     Kevin and I decided to utilize our college kid energy to make sure we passed the crowds.</p>
<p>We stayed up to 2am that night getting the bag ready for the morning. Then, we just slept at the base of the cliff and waited 
    until morning. At around 5am, I awoke to a flashlight in my face. For a second I was scared it was rangers but it turned out
     to just be an exceptionally motivated team on the approach to something way too hard for us to climb.</p>
<p>At 6am we got out of our sleeping bags, devoured some snacks, and racked up. I was leading the first pitch before 6:45am. First
     group on the wall. Good old night ops to take the lead.</p>
<p>Before we started climbing, I walked out below The South Face for my “morning walk”. Two things happened on this walk. The 
    first was that I found a Micro nut that proved to be the single most important piece on our rack. And the second was that I 
    dropped our only roll of toilet paper off the cliff and into a tree way below. That became an issue later. But luckily we had 
    the micro nut.</p>
<p>I used that nut a couple times on pitch one on the really thin crack, cam hooking in between placements so i could back clean 
    the micronut.</p>
<p>Pitch two was the hardest one for me to lead I think. It had thin and suspect gear placements. The micronut was getting put to 
    work on this pitch and I felt very lucky every time I got an alright microcam placement. I felt pretty accomplished once I
     arrived at the anchor.</p>
<p>I think the third pitch was my favorite to lead. A C1 roof right off the belay followed by a C1 crack until nearly reaching 
    Anchorage Ledge. The next like 15 feet were some awkward aid placements and also relied on trusting beat-to-shit bashies that
     were probably as old as I was.</p>
<p>We decided to set up camp on Anchorage ledge but still had time to continue up. At this point, Kevin took the lead and led off 
    on Pitch 4 making a really good time. He fixed the rope for the morning and rappelled back down so we could set up camp.</p>
<p>I feasted on my big wall meal of choice which was Trader Joe's lentils poured in a pack of unheated Uncle Ben's minute rice. 
    Filling but not the most tasty cold, eh, it did the trick.</p>
<p>I drank some of the wine I brought and passed out before it even got dark.</p>
<p>Sleeping in the portaledge was an experience. The ledge we used was an old black diamond ledge that had to have been from the 
    early 2000’s. No shade at all, it was great, just the ledge was more of a hammock and Kevin and I ended up involuntarily 
    cuddling most of the night.</p>
<p>Light pouring into the valley was our alarm to start the day.</p>
<p>Have you ever taken a “morning walk” into a gallon plastic bag while standing 2 feet away from another guy? Have you ever used 
    pieces of your brown paper trader joes food bag as toilet paper while standing in a hammock 400 feet above the ground?</p>

<p>Camp broke down really fast and we jugged up to our high point from the day prior. Kevin took the lead on pitch 5 which also 
    went cruiser. I was pretty impressed by the placements he was able to make as I followed the pitch.</p>
<p>At the top of pitch 5, we turned to admire the view and saw clouds BOILING across the valley. 40 percent chance of rain all of 
    the sudden for the next 4 days.</p>

<p>We had to be back in classes in 2 days. Although we did have a rainfly and technically enough food and water, it wasn't worth 
    the risk. If we got stuck in the ledge and missed classes it could seriously impact our school. We chose to bail for that
     reason. Bummer.</p>
<p>Rappelling with the haul bag was pretty fun to figure out. The rappels went pretty smoothly apart from the issues associated 
    with rappelling with 150 pounds of gear.</p>
<p>As the wind picked up, pieces of toilet paper from the dropped roll flew past us. I still feel bad about this and picked up a 
    bunch of trash at the base to pay for my sins.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it did not end up raining that day or the next, and we were on track to make the summit. That's alright though, 
    hindsight is 20/20. It just wasn't worth the risk of missing school.</p>
<p>The next day, we did some easy free climbing near the 5 open books area. We climbed Werner's Ant Trees (10c) and The Surprise 
    (10a). Phenomenal day.</p>
<p>Although we bailed off The Prow, so did every other party on the wall. The weather was coming in fast. I think we made the right 
    decision, still, even months later.</p>
<p>Also when I go back to complete the climb I will be bringing more than one micro nut. That would be useful.</p>
