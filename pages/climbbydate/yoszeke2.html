<p>
As of lately, every Friday has had a constant routine: wake up, go to class, get out of class at 4pm, race my bike home, 
and be on my way to Tahoe by 4:15pm. It’s just what I've gotten into the habit of doing. However, this weekend I broke my 
routine for a pretty good reason. Zeke and I were going to Yosemite. 
</p>

<p>
I woke up in my bed on a saturday morning for the first time since i had gotten back from Alaska. Cool anyway. Zeke didn't get 
off work until 1pm that day so I spent the morning packing for the trip which took all of about 15 minutes. Throw the haul bag 
in the car. In goes the camping box. Grab the food bag from the kitchen. Ok good to go. I kinda just waited until 1 and then 
was off.
</p>

<p>
The first step was to drive to downtown Sacramento, where Zeke and I would meet and we’d grab his brother's car. His brother's 
car is a toyota corolla or honda civic or something smaller like that and we really liked the high gas mileage. We were on the 
road by 2pm. We listened to music from a JBL speaker on the way to the valley since the car stereo didn't work. Apart from being
very carsick and or hungover the drive went great.
</p>

<p>
Upon arrival, we were obligated to go straight to swan slab. We only had about 15 minutes of daylight left and knew we should 
probably use it. Both of us had climbed Swan Slab Gully (5.6 3p) before so we chose it for an easy romp in the dark. I took the
first pitch and all went well. By the time Zeke reached the anchor, the headlamp was a necessity. Our one headlamp. No worries
though, I gave Zeke the headlamp and he led up. I followed pitch 2 climbing by braille. Surprisingly, you have a lot more 
trust in your feet when you cannot see them. At the anchor Zeke handed me the light and I wrapped up the climb uneventfully.
We hungout at the top of the climb for a little but, watching the stars above and the cars below. Then we left.
</p>

<p>
We drove the car to that spot in El Portal, yeah that spot, and pulled over for the night. We just reclined the seats and called 
it good. I used a wool blanket I brought to keep me warm. 
</p>

<p>
We woke up before the kiosk opened. Before the sun was up. Before any other climbers made it to the parking lot for the Royal 
Arches approach. To get the day started I made some instant coffee in my jet boil on the top of Zeke’s brother’s car. We each 
had a bagel and one and a half bananas. We started approaching the climb as the sky began to brighten.
</p>

<p>
The plan for the day was to climb Royal Arches, 5.7 15p or something like that. After, we were going to go over to the 5 open
books area and get on some other easy classics. The day started great, arriving at the base of the climb to a follower inching
their way up the p1 chimney. With nobody behind us, we took our time to put on our shoes and rack up. I took p1 and began
grunting my way up the chimney. Let's just say i'm not the biggest fan of chimneys. Anyway after reaching the first 
chockstone, the pitch became pretty fun. Then the pitch ended. 
</p>



<p>
After belaying up zeke, the plan was to simul until the climbing got more vertical around pitch 5. We did pretty much just that.
I got to the top of pitch 5 and met up with Zeke. My turn to lead. Now for some reason someone (me) decided to lead up the 
5.8/9 offwidth to the right instead of continuing on the route in the corner on the left. At the moment, I wasn't really
thinking. I saw a cool crack and I set off to climb a cool crack. The first couple moves were some liebacking before entering 
absolutely perfect hand jams for another 15 feet. Then, the crack widened. I placed a BD number 2 and continued upwards. At
the beginning of the crack only the front of my foot fit inside, now I was able to shove my ankles in. About 15 feet above 
my last cam, I realized the crack was getting too large for my second number 2… I better place it now. So in went the tipped
out number 2 from the early 2000s. Almost Immediately after, I pulled out the number 3 and began bumping. I'll spare you 
the details for the next 30 minutes but it involved lots of swearing and bumping my only number 3 and 4. Finally, I made it
out of the offwidth and onto a slab that was protected by a dirty crack. You could pull out chunks of grass and find where
you wanted to place a cam. About 45 meters of rope later I climbed into a tree and was safe. Zeke flew up the pitch. 
Apparently he liebacked the entire thing and was about 5x faster than I was. While sitting in the tree, we decided we 
should rap off as the wind was picking up and our stoke had been curbed.

<p>
We had to make two rappels to where we deviated from Royal Arches, one out of the aforementioned tree, and one off of a 
chockstone halfway up the offwidth. The rappels went relatively smoothly except for when I dropped part of my rope in the 
crack and thought for sure I would have to cut it. Luckily some careful tugs got it loose. Back on the ground safely, we 
scarfed down some bagels from the bottom of my backpack. Just enough to hold us over until dinner where we would meet Chongo
Chuck.
</p>

<p>In the words of Chongo:</p>
<p>A clock moving at the speed of light doesn’t tick.</p>
<p>A ruler measuring the clock's distance traveled is infinitesimal.</p>
<p>Anything that can be measured by that ruler is too small to exist.  </p>
