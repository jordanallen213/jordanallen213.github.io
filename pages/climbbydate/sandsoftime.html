<h1>Sands of Time With Jacob July 9-10 2022</h1>

<p>
    Looking back on this trip, i'm kind of amazed that we pulled it off. Having a whopping two years of climbing experience combined,
    we had no business doing what we were about to do. Ignorance is bliss.
</p>

<p>Our plan was to head out to climb Sands of Time (5.9 12p) at Calaveras Domes. We decided that free climbing the route would be
    too simple, so we decided that we would also haul the first 6 pitches and camp on the bivy ledge half way up the climb. Obviously,
    neither of us have hauled before and we had no idea how any of that worked. The week before the climb i practiced hauling a bag of 
    rocks up a single pitch climb using only a prussick and my atc in guide mode- the definition of hell.
</p>

<p>
    I Spent the absolute last of my money on a micro traction from REI while on the way to Cal Domes.

<p>
    Prepare yourself for the junk show that follows.
</p>

<p> Pitch one of the climb was my first experience with home made anchor bolts. At the time, i didnt see these as uninspiring.</p>

<p>I remember spending an ungodly amount of time at the top of the second pitch as we waited for a party to pass us. Since we
    were partywalling an easy free climb, it wouldve been a dick move for us to not let them pass. Plus i needed a break after
    hauling 2 pitches.

<p>Jacob led the next pitch, which i dont have photos of. But I remember him very vividly pulling a roof, then proceeding
 to get the lead rope stuck in said roof, preventing any more upwards progress. He then untied, free soloed to the anchor, and fixed the haul line.
 Couldve been safer but it worked lol. I top rope soloed on the fixed rope, cleaning the pitch and eventually freeing the stuck rope.
 Jacob got the pleasure of hauling this pitch.
</p>

<p>We cruised up the next blocky short pitch then moved the belay to the bottom of the crux pitch. I did not know this was the crux
 pitch, or that it would involve a squeeze, so i chose to lead with my backpack. Still, to this day i'm relatively surprised that
 pitch went as smoothly as it did. I remember feeling relieved when i was able to climb out of the chimney onto the friction slab to the right.

<p>The next two pitches were a rope length of finger crack followed by a rope length of friction slab. Playing to our strengths,
    Jacob got the glory pitch and i got the scary friction slab. To be fair i had a lot of fun on the slab pitch and would love to 
    lead it again.

<p>As I followed the pitch, using a gri gri to ascend, Jacob hauled the bags. They swung out to the right into free hanging space.
I paused my climbing for a second to admire the views and snap a few pictures.

<p>My lead to the top of pitch 6 broght us to the ledge we would call home for the night. Due to spending all day, sun up to sun down,
    climbing only 6 pitches, we were pretty beat and went to bed immediately.
