</figure>



<p>Looking back on this trip, I'm kind of amazed that we pulled it off. Having a whopping two years of climbing experience combined 
(most of that carried by Jacob), we had no business trying to do what we were about to do. Ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>Our plan was to head out to climb Sands of Time (5.9 12p) at Calaveras Domes. We decided that free climbing the route would be 
too simple, so we would also haul the first 6 pitches and camp on the bivy ledge half way up the climb. Obviously, neither of
us have hauled before and we had no idea how any of that worked. The week before the climb I practiced hauling a bag of rocks 
up a single pitch climb using only a prussik and my ATC in guide mode- the definition of hell.</p>
<p>I Spent the absolute last of my money on an overpriced micro-traction from REI while on the way to Cal Domes.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at Cal Domes, we did what any sensible 20 year olds would do and bushwhacked straight through a forest of poison 
oak, oblivious to the trail 50 meters to our right. We didn't have much time to climb that evening but at least it allowed us
to bring half of our stuff up to Silk Road Corner.</p>
<p>As we were getting ready to turn in for the night down the road at one of the dispersed campsites, a car pulled up and asked if 
they could share the site. We said yeah of course given it was just ONE car. Next thing we know there were about 8 cars crammed
in our campsite, lights strung from the trees, and chatter throughout the night. I guess they were the leaders of the group or 
something. Live and learn.</p>
<p>Anyways we awoke early and started carrying our second load of gear to the base of the climb. This time we used the trail we 
finally found the night before.</p>
<p>Pitch one of the climb was relatively chill. The top of the pitch was my first ever experience with home made anchor bolts 
made from what looks like some sort of bent sheet metal. At the time they didn't worry me whatsoever. Now, I might be skeptical
to blindly trust them; although they were obviously fine and we lived. Checkout a photo of them in the photos section.</p>
<p>I remember spending an ungodly amount of time at the top of the second pitch as we waited for a party to pass us. Since we were
partywalling an easy free climb, it would've been rude for us to not let them pass. Plus I needed a break after hauling 2 
pitches.</p>
<p>Jacob led the next pitch, which I don't have photos of. But I remember him very vividly pulling a roof, then proceeding to 
get the lead rope stuck in said roof, preventing any more upwards progress. He then untied, free soloed to the anchor, and 
fixed the haul line for me to TRS on. Could've been safer but it worked lol. I top rope soloed on the fixed rope, cleaning 
the pitch and eventually freeing the stuck rope. Jacob got the pleasure of hauling this pitch.</p>
<p>We cruised up the next blocky short pitch then moved the belay to the bottom of the crux pitch. I did not know this was the 
crux pitch, or that it would involve a squeeze, so my malinformed decision was to lead the pitch with my backpack. Still, to 
this day I'm relatively surprised that the pitch went as smoothly as it did. I remember feeling relieved when I was able to 
climb out of the chimney onto the friction slab to the right.</p>
<p>The next two pitches were a rope length of finger crack followed by a rope length of friction slab. Playing to our strengths, 
Jacob got the glory pitch and I got the scary friction slab. As I followed the fifth pitch, using a grigri to ascend, Jacob 
hauled the bags. They swung out to the right into free hanging space. I paused my climbing for a second to admire the views 
and snap a few pictures (the photo of the free hanging bags in the photo section).</p>
<p>To be fair I had a lot of fun on the slab pitch and would love to get back on it. It went at like 5.6 R maybe 5.7 max. I can't 
remember the difficulty other than it was cruiser. I remember placing a yellow TCU behind a flexy undercling flake thing that 
apparently popped once the rope was fixed for TRS following.</p>
<p>My lead to the top of pitch 6 brought us to the ledge we would call home for the night. Due to spending all day, sun up to sun 
down, climbing only 6 pitches, we were pretty beat and went to bed immediately.</p>
<p>In the morning we got a quick start and packed up our day pack for the summit day. Our plan was to climb the next 6 pitches to
the summit, then rappel the silk road rap route with a variation and meet back up with our haul bags on 12 o’clock ledge. 
Then, we’d continue rappelling the silk road rappel route to the ground.</p>

<p>We opted for the right variation off the ledge in a low angle dihedral. Not much happened for the first 4 pitches of the day, 
they were all really fun and really cruiser climbing.</p>
<p>At some point before the 5th pitch we (me) got way off route on some runout slabs and ended up belaying off a suspect anchor 
in a crumbly flake. Jacob made it up to me and we diligently traded gear before he quested onwards. We knew we were about 
1- 2 pitches from the top and all that was in the way was about 60 meters of friction slab. Jacob quested onwards, immediately
placing a cam in the flake and then charging onwards out of sight.</p>
<p>He was nearing the end of the rope but showing no sign of stopping. The wind was howling and I hadn’t seen him for about 15 
minutes. I was screaming to him “10 meters… 5 meters… 1 meter..” then I had to deconstruct the anchor to keep feeding the 
rope. The rope came tight on my harness and it was time for an impromptu simul climb. Luckily, I gained sight of Jacob about 
40 feet later and saw him reach a tree. I relaxed for a second at a stance while he put me on belay. At this point I noticed 
the singular nut on the entire pitch that held us onto the rock. No fall zone I guess. To be fair this was easy like 5.8 
slab.</p>
<p>We laughed about the experience and were relieved to make the summit. After snacks we made our way to the rappel route.</p>
<p>The only shenanigan on the rappels were when we got the rope stuck, and I had to TRS on said stuck rope to free it. I was 
tied into our second rope, but the pitch I had minimal gear placements, and I was only able to get like 3 pieces in the 
entire rope length, none were inspiring. At the top I freed the stuck rope and then rappelled out of a manzanita bush the 
size of my forearm. I don't like thinking about that whole thing.</p>
<p>The rest of the day was spent doing full length rappels with our bags, meanwhile desperately needing water and to take a
shit. Luckily we had no accidents, both figurative and literal.</p>
<p>The end, then we drove home hooray.</p>
