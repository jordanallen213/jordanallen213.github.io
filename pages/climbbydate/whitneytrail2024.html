         Its more of an easy snow climb than switchbacks at this point in the season.</figcaption>

After bailing off the mountaineers route of mount whitney due to altitude sickness complications, we were still determined to make the summit
</p>

<p>We started up the mount whitney trail after dark for about 4 miles until reaching outpost camp. We spent the night there (10,000ft?). We hauled a 10L bag of water up the trail so that we wouldnt need to spend time melting water in the morning.</p>

<p>At 4:30am we woke up and i was moving by 5:15. Breaking trail took lots of effort but i kept it up until reaching the summit at 1:15pm.</p>

<p>There was a part that had some pretty fun moderate snow climbing that can be seen in the photos below.</p>

<p>On the descent i opted to glissade the couloir to the right of the snowed over switch backs. That saved me about 30 mintes and allowed me to meet back up with the rest of the gang.
 </p>

<p> At about 3pm i took my first break of the day. Then I hobbled back to camp and then the car.</p>

<p>Overall great day, great weather, great people, and great fun.</p>
