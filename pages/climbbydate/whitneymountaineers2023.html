This really got us stoked for the couple days of shivering to come!</figcaption>

<p>The only responsibility I had on friday was to carry one bin and 2 backpacks of gear from my room to the front door of the 
apartment. I was bringing nearly all the climbing gear I had on this trip, given we were not really sure how the weekend was 
going to play out. In one of my bags I had my rope, a rack of cams, a couple belay devices and ascenders for the crew, some 
coord to bail off in an emergency, and snow pickets because why not.</p>

<p>Our plan was to climb up the Mountaineers Route on Mount Whitney, although given the weather conditions, we weren't exactly sure
how the weekend was going to play out. We decided to play it safe and take the “bring everything” approach just in case we had
to alter our plans and spend the weekend cragging or soaking in hot springs.</p>

<p>Around midday, Brede and Elaine picked me up and we made our way from Sacramento down to Lone Pine where we met up with Jake and
Atalie. On the drive, we could not contain our excitement and pointed out all the major peaks while heading south on 395.</p>

<p>We posted up for the night in Alabama Hills, right below the Whitney Portal. The night was spent cooking a nice warm meal and 
plotting the next day's adventure. I went to bed as early as I could, sheltered from the wind by walls that reminded me of 
Joshua Tree.</p>

<p>Our plan was to wake up early and move as far up the mountaineers route as possible before a weather system came in on the 
evening of the 30th. The weather was supposed to be brief and would allow for a summit push on Sunday if all went to plan. Our 
goal for the 30th was to make it to Iceberg lake for the night.</p>

<p>Hoots and hollers erupted from our campsite as we awoke before sunrise on the 30th. Coffee was brewed and random snacks found in
the car were eaten.</p>

<p>The sunrise ignited a stoke within us so warm that we had no second thoughts running straight towards a winter storm in the 
sierras.</p>

<p>The first mile of the Whitney Trail was cake, if you've done it you know. The turn off to the mountaineers route was also very 
clearly marked. At this point, the crampons went on as the incline steepened while the snow deepend. Eventually, we found 
ourselves at the Ebersbacher Ledges, which was probably my favorite part of our brief trip. Although the ledges only go at 
3rd class, with the winter conditions and ~50lb packs, they were plenty engaging for the group. There are some photos of the 
E Ledges in the google photos folder.</p>

<p>Reaching lower boyscout lake indicated it was lunch time. It was also at this point that the weather decided to come in. 
Early. Luckily, the forecast was only calling for about an inch of snow to fall, but the real kicker was the fog. As we 
ascended from lower boyscout, the fog thickened and made it nearly impossible to pick landmarks ahead of us. Although the 
conditions made for a challenge, it was honestly pretty fun. People often don't experience the mountains during a storm and 
it can be a test of dedication when you are in a situation like that.</p>

<p>Due to let's say uhh route finding difficulties, we only made it to upper boyscout lake by about 4pm. The group decided to 
post up there for the night since pushing onto Iceberg Lake would ensure arriving in darkness. I was fine with that and was 
dead asleep by 6pm knowing id be waking up early for a summit push.</p>

<p>At 4am, way later than we should have woken up at, it was revealed that one of the members of the group had been throwing up 
due to altitude sickness during the night. That's alright, we shall go down. We should've woken up earlier if we wanted a 
chance at the summit anyway. We spent the morning loitering around camp before descending since we were in no real rush and 
the altitude sickness situation wasn't getting any worse.</p>

<p>I thought it was pretty funny how everything in my tent that could freeze, did freeze. My water bottles, cliff bars, the
ramen I spilled on my sleeping bag. Although I was not unbearably cold, everything else around me was. I was lucky enough 
to have snow to melt for water just an arms length away and didn't even need to leave my tent to grab it.</p>

<p>Probably the coolest part on the descent was seeing the large ice formation to the climbers left of the approach trail. On 
the ascent, none of us were able to see anything, and waking up to a clear sky made it feel as if we had been transported 
to another planet.</p>

<p>Anyway that's our attempt on the mountaineers route of mount whitney. We didn't even reach the start of the route so I guess
you could call it a fun winter storm backpacking trip with extra gear. Even then, id gladly repeat what we did as it was 
honestly really fun.</p>
