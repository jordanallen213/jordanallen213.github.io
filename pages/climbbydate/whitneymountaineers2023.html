<h1> Mount Whitney Via The Mountaineers Route</h1>
<p>December 30-31st of 2023</p>

<p>
On the 29th of December, Brede and Elaine and I drove from sacramento down to lone pine where we met up with Jake and Atalie. We set up a quick camp in Alabama Hills where we schemed for the next morning.
</p>

<p>The plan was to do the mountaineers route of mount whitney. The 30th was going to be stormy but wasnt going to drop too much snow. Then the 31st was going to be nice weather suitable for a summit. 
    We were aiming to sleep at iceberg lake, about 4 miles from the trailhead.
</p>

<p>The ascent started very smoothly, using the E Ledges as the snow levels hadnt filled in enough to make the creek passable by walking on top.
    At lower boyscout lake though the weather came in fast. This slowed our progress significantly as we couldnt see any landmarks around us. Due to tht we only made it to upper boyscout lake by evening.

</p>

<p> It was probably a good idea to stop there however, because one of the members of our party ended up having elevation sickness and threw up. We all decided to turn around just to be safe.</p>

<p>Regardless of the end result, i loved the beginning of the route and cant wait to go back when i get the chance.</p>
