<p>Trinidad convinced me to get a pair of approach shoes for this climb. I'm still not entirely sold on them lol. I’d sell em if 
anyone wants to buy them for like 50$. Shoot me an email. (LS TX4R 44.5eu?). To be fair this climb wouldn't have been 
possible without the shoes. Thanks Trinidad!</p>
<p>All month Trinidad and I had been slobbering over the idea of questing up the jagged west ridge of Panorama Mountain. Anyone 
that has driven the Parks Highway from Anchorage to Denali Park has seen Panorama. Those that have seen it know that it is 
pretty much a mound of dirt lined with adventure worthy ribs of rock (slightly harder dirt). Like any guide in their early 
twenties- we saw rock and had to climb rock- regardless of the quality.</p>
<p>By far the most popular route up Panorama is by the South Couloir and is done as a snow climb. People climb the mountain in 
the early morning before the ice melts and rocks start to shed. Since Trinidad and I were climbing this in the summer, with 
no snow to secure the rocks, we figured a late start wouldn't hurt.</p>
<p>On the car ride to Panorama we stopped by Creekside and got an Alaskan sized cinnamon roll we’d heat on the dash of the car
until we finished the climb. Post climb reward. Then, Trinidad drove BACK to camp to grab a harness we forgot as I sat on 
the side of the highway and organized the rack.</p>
<p>A caravan of RVers watched in curiosity. Probably wondering what some disheveled kid was doing on the side of the highway in 
Alaska. They could see rope, carabiners, and other doodads strung about the pavement.</p>
<p>Eventually Trinidad showed back up and the RVers watched us slink into the trees across the highway.</p>
<p>Our proposed route was to climb onto the first ridge we could get on, and stay on the ridge until the top. This would be the 
best course of action for two main reasons. The big one was that there was no snow to hold the rocks together and the gullies in between ridges were absolute death zones. Staying on top of the ridges would mitigate that. Wow, revolutionary!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, we are rock climbers. Gotta climb the rock, not hike up the scree.</p>
<p>Given the plan, we bought along a rope and light rack. Along with helmets (mine was a whitewater helmet since that was all I 
could scrounge up given I was living on a raft camp). We also brought a JBL boombox. Since the pack was already larger than 
normal, and I was the one that would carry it, I tossed in some summit beers as well.</p>
<p>Normally, we are rather good at pacing ourselves on climbs, but for the first couple hundred feet of the climb we absolutely 
bolted. For some ungodly reason the mosquitos in the alder trees here were ravenous, even though it was the end of July.</p>
<p>Mosquitos in Alaska are a different breed; you can slap them and somehow they will just get back up and come for you again. It 
seemed like THESE mosquitoes were the cream of the Alaskan crop. After about 45 minutes of practically crawling through alder 
trees we made it to the first bit of exposure on a ridge. The mosquitos lingered in the trees, like a bunch of dogs barking 
from the other side of a chain link fence. Both Trinidad and I needed a break at this point.</p>
<p>We then slogged up some scree and scrambled over some 3rd class rock for a couple hundred feet. The rock here really puts 
meaning to the phrase “the geologic timeline includes now”. You could flick certain rock with your fingers and a bowling ball 
amount of choss would crumble off. I'm not kidding. Nightmare material.</p>
<p>We filled up empty water bottles in a little creek we found and saved them for later as emergency water. It wasn't clean enough
to be inspiring drinking water. But if it came down to it- I don't know- it’d probably be worth the risk. I doubt anyone has 
shat in that water recently, if ever.</p>
<p>After a little more 3rd and easy 4th we roped up for the first 5th class of the climb. The rock was terrible (surprising right) 
but easy to climb. Overall it made for a pretty thoughtful and engaging pitch. We simul climbed the pitch and then climbed an 
easy low 5th slab to a notch in the ridge that overlooked the slime creek drainage.</p>
<p>At this point Trin led off again in a mini death gully and tunneled underneath a massive flake just resting across the gully. 
I wish I had a photo but I was too engaged with getting ready to play dodgeball with any rocks that could come my way.</p>
<p>Following this pitch I experienced what we began calling “temporary holds”. Holds that were good for about 5 seconds until the 
rock began crumbling around them and you had to find another hold before the whole thing fell off. Again let's call it 
“engaging “ climbing. That pitch ended us at another notch on the proper west ridge. We did a short scramble to a peaklet 
that overlooked the Nenana and took some classic climbing photos. The one of Trinidad overlooking the valley is from here.
That's the photo at the top of the page.</p>

<p>The next pitch was the technical crux of the climb. It was about 20 feet of barely protectable face climbing before
     entering a chimney for another 20-30 feet. At this point we were accustomed to the shedding rock and felt fine. This 
     pitch went at 5.6 and although not strenuous at all you have to be careful.</p>
<p>That pitch brought us up to a slightly overhanging horn above a notch. This is the commitment point on the route. If you 
    rappel off this horn into the notch, you must summit or figure out a clever bail plan. The horn could probably be downclimbed 
    at about 5.9 given the overhang, but a fall would send you tumbling a thousand feet down a gully. We opted to rappel off 
    the horn and pull the rope.</p>
<p>Just like that, we passed the metaphorical and physical point of no return. It was fine though, since we thought the summit 
    was right ahead of us. We thought.</p>
<p>We climbed up another short pitch of 5.6 face climbing from the notch before putting the rope away for a while. At this 
    point, we had a couple granola bars left and were still pretty determined as it looked like only a summit slog on some 
    scree was ahead of us.</p>
<p>Now, one of the biggest downfalls of this excursion was that we did next to no recon. We both really wanted to preserve 
    the adventure of the experience and decided to go into the climb blind. 100% quest mode. There’s no documentation on 
    this route anywhere online, but even breaking out the binoculars from the road would have told us everything we needed 
    to know. That would've been cheating though ya know.</p>
<p>Anyway, after a little slogging, we thought we were having a pretty good time, until we reached the FALSE summit. I got 
    real hungry here haha. A quarter mile of knifeblade, practically DIRT towers stood between us and the true summit block. 
    The good news at this point though was that the mountain had a pretty cool looking summit block we were going to climb</p>

</figure>

<p>Here I ate my second to last granola bar. I could've eaten probably 5 more if i had them.</p>
<p>The rope came out once again. We short roped nearly this entire section, weaving the rope between features in the ridge so 
that if one of us fell, it would catch us. Either that or one of us would have to brace on the other side of the ridge to 
catch the team.</p>
<p>As we climbed along, our falling rocks spooked some Dall Sheep a thousand feet below us.</p>
<p>At one point, we could not figure out how to get OVER a tower, and we were stumped on how to get past it at all. We ended up 
finding a chimney/offwidth that we could downclimb to get below the tower. Then, we could traverse around the tower and gain 
the ridge again. We didn’t bring any protection over a size 2, so this was going to require some careful climbing.</p>
<p>Since Trinidad had led everything prior, we opted to give him a mental break and give him a top rope. I did make him wear the
follower backpack though. I belayed him from the opposite side of the ridge as he downclimbed the chimney at about 5.6. 
Then, I had the pleasure of downclimbing after him, with no protection. I remember squeezing my body as far into the crack
as I could so I wouldn't fall out. I was still tied into the rope but a fall at this point would have just kept my body 
from rolling down the mountain.</p>

<p>The traverse then required its own set of shenanigans. We had to downclimb a corner (think like stemming), that was made 
entirely of dirt. Not even temporary holds here. We took turns belaying each other from the ridgetop as we passed this 
part.</p>
<p>The remainder of the climb was pretty epic. Knifeblade like ridges and easy 4th class all the way to the summit block. 
We had the summit beers I carried all the way up there and took in the views of the slime creek drainage. In the other 
direction the Alaska Range was looking spectacular.</p>

<p>We descended down the South East couloir. In the winter, people ski this. In the summer, you can scree ski here. Pretty epic.</p>
<p>Along the way we found a spring that was probably the best water I had all summer. I brought some of this water back to camp 
and drank it over the next couple of days instead of drinking the well water.</p>
<p>The trip ended with hitchhiking down the side of the highway. Let's be honest, all the best climbing trips end this way. The 
lady that picked us up thought it was funny we only needed a lift 2 miles down the road. We could have walked but like that 
was so much more fun.</p>
<p>The cinnamon roll we left in the car made a great snack and made it back by midnight in time for dinner at camp!</p>
<p>All in all the route went at about 5.6 and gained about 1600 feet. A rope was required for the rappel off the horn. The route
is by no means classic but it was definitely the adventure we set out for.</p>
