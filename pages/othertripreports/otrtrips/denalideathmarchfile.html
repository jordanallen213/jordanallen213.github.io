<p>Despite encountering 16 grizzly bears, while solo, in one day, and hiking 74 miles total in 4 days, this trip wasn't as bad 
  as it seems. It was actually great. It was one of my favorite trips of the summer. I have quite a few favorite trips- they were 
  all good.</p>
<p>Day 0 of this trip involved picking up permits and a bus ticket immediately after finishing my 5 hour hike with some guests. 
  The rangers at the backcountry office didn't like my plan to hike 25-27 miles to Eielson in one day. I had to walk that far 
  though in one day to meet up with Jake, Brede, and Atalie who were coming to meet me from Kantishna.</p>
<p>I had met Brede in my WFR course earlier in the year, and we were pretty hyped when we found out we were both going to be 
  working in denali. Unfortunately, we were working about 80 miles away from each other. The only way to link up was to take a 
  bus for 40 miles down a dirt road then we would each walk 20ish miles and meet in the middle.</p>
<p>We had schemes of this plan for a while and once the dates lined up, it was go time.</p>
<p>I had to borrow cooking gear from Luc and a tent as well. Thanks Luc for helping me make this happen!</p>
<p>On Day 1 I swiped our company van and drove myself to the bus station at 5:30am. At 6am I was the only person on the bus out 
  to mile 43 of the park road. On the way the bus driver and I saw a mama grizzly fighting off another grizzly to protect her 3 
  cubs. Apparently male grizzlies will try and eat the babies of other grizzlies to reduce competition. That whole thing was 
  pretty exciting, seeing them tumble down a hill and all.</p>
<p>At 830am i got dropped off at mile 43 and was on my way by 9am. I had to navigate my way through 5 miles of creeks and bushes 
  to get around a landslide. The rangers say it takes 5-8 hours to get past this part. I was pretty happy with my time of 1 hour 
  and 48 minutes. I would have been faster but I had to spend some time scaring off another grizzly bear so I could continue up 
  the canyon/wash thing.</p>
<p>My secret for this part of the trip was to wear sandals and short shorts. Even though it was cold out(I had to wear a puffy 
  jacket), the shorts were worth it so I didn't get anything else wet. Once I got to the road, boots and pants went on.</p>
<p>While drying off at the road I saw a ground squirrel dart out of the bushes, followed by another grizzly bear. We made eye 
  contact and it started walking directly towards me. I was waving my hiking poles and telling it to go away but it was 
  undeterred. I had my bear spray out and off safety. Luckily, it turned into the bushes about 15 meters from me. I got outta 
  there pretty fast after that.</p>
<p>Then I started my death march. I took my first break 10 miles later at the toklat river to eat a salami sandwich. On the way 
  there I walked through a patch of some especially large wolf prints that were pretty cool. My feet were insanely blistered at 
  this point from getting wet in the creeks then being put into socks. I should have rethought my plan but whatever. After a short 
  break and foot taping I was off.</p>

    </figure>
<p>While cruising through the highway pass I ran into MANY grizzly bears. I don't remember the exact count of how many were at 
  what part but I remember a total of 16 for this day. My head was on a swivel all day.</p>
<p>I took a short break after seeing all the bars to eat some bars and refill my water. I was 17 miles in and still had 8-10 to
   go.</p>
<p>When I got to the Eielson visitor center, I took my third break of the day and ate another bagel.</p>
<p>Lots of people think it's funny that I take a roll of bagels and sticks of salami on trips like these. It is probably the most 
  convenient meal though. Carbs, fat, protein. You get the macros for a good push. This kept me going until I eventually met up 
  with the rest of the squad at around mile 27. It was around 8pm when we all found each other.</p>
<p>I guess that means my unofficial 27 mile ultra marathon time is like 11 hours lol. I had a ton of weight and had to fight off 
  the bears!! I coulda been faster.</p>
<p>We set up camp and I went to sleep worked.</p>

<p>On day 2 we got a really early start since the entire day was going to be off trail. We smashed through willow thickets as 
  Denali loomed over us in the distance. For a brief moment the alaska range was painted cotton candy pink by the sunrise. Our 
  first challenge of the day was crossing the Thorofare, a wash of knee deep, freezing cold, glacier fed water.</p>

    </figure>
<p>After crossing that with no mishaps, we continued up glacier creek, the portal into the god lands. Glacier creek is wide and 
  braided, influenced from the glacial silts that are produced from glaciers just upstream. We continued on until reaching an 
  overlook onto the Muldrow glacier where we set up camp.</p>
<p>The Muldrow glacier is formed on Denali and flows north into the McKinley river. A few years ago, the glacier surged, moving 
  30-60 feet per day. The turmoil chopped up what used to be a crossable glacier into a rocky and crevasse filled debris field. 
  In this state, nobody is crossing anything. Even now, the glacier can move up to 11 inches per day.</p>

    </figure>

<p>The rest of the squad continued onwards to Anderson Pass while I rested in the tent and stretched. I needed the rest after the
   day I had before.</p>
<p>During the night you could hear the glacier churning, rocks falling, and unknown large objects scraping together as they pushed 
  north.</p>
<p>On day 3 Brede and I woke up early and got a head start towards Eielson to ensure my legs were strong enough. They were pretty 
  good although I had to tape up my knee for some extra support. We ate lunch and then I headed east towards toklat and Brede 
  headed west towards Kantishna to reconvene with Jake and Atalie.</p>
<p>By the time I got to Toklat I was so beat. For some reason, walking downhill was the hardest for me. Flat land was the second 
  most strenuous. Uphills were my safe space. Unfortunately the last 4 miles to the toklat basin are all downhill. I hobbled into 
  camp, set up my tent, ate my ramen, then slept until 5am.</p>
<p>On day 4 I had to cover 10 miles to make it back to the bus stop. I wanted to make it back as early as possible so I could 
  hitchhike from the park back to basecamp and sleep. The 10 miles went really fast, not going to lie.</p>
<p>At the creek crossings there were hikers stripping down into their underwear to cross. I was already wet and working so I just 
  jumped in and waded across. We all laughed and I continued on without saying many more words.</p>
<p>Back at the bus stop I ate some food and got onto one of the tourist buses. Those buses were lowkey terrible. I took a nap to 
  pass the time.</p>
<p>At the front of the park, out of luck, some of my friends were driving past and were able to get me a ride back to camp.</p>
<p>I was extremely grateful that I had the next day off as well to recover before going back to work.</p>
