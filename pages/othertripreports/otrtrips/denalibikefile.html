<p>For the last month I have been working two jobs. The first was working as a hiking guide near Denali National Park. 
The second, on my off days, was working as a white water raft repair person. I worked with my friend, who I met in Alaska, 
named David. He and I would repair the rafts, drysuits, and oars using glues and nasty chemicals like toluene and all that 
good stuff. We spent many good days in the suit room sniffing glue and listening to the blues (just joking).</p>
<p>Anyway David would always bring up wanting to ride his bike out to Wonder Lake. Wonder lake is at mile 85 of the park road. 
Requiring a 42 mile bike ride both there and back.</p>
<p>We recruited our friend Luc to join the team.</p>

<p>David had brought his bike from home so he was all set. Luc was able to borrow a bike from another person living at camp. 
Luckily, there were a couple mid 90’s to 2000’s era bikes sitting around camp that I was able to build into one functional 
bike that I could use on the trip. Building the bike was pretty epic and I used it a lot throughout the summer.</p>
<p>Once there was an opening for all of us to have a couple days off we took the chance and bought tickets on the bus to drop us 
off at mile 43 of the park road. After being dropped off, we'd have to navigate 5 miles around a landslide before regaining the 
road. Then, we would be able to travel on the road however we pleased.</p>

<p>Right before the bus dropped us off it started pouring rain. We waited in the shelter bus before deciding we better go for it 
if we wanted to make it to camp on time.</p>
<p>As the rain hammered on, the creeks in our detour continued to rise. There were multiple knee deep crossings that included full 
packs and heavy bikes.</p>
<p>After all the creek crossings we also had to endure an uphill bushwack battle to gain the road. Unknown to us, there was an 
easier way about 0.1 miles up the wash.</p>
<p>We set up camp at about 2am and went to sleep.</p>
<p>I woke up once through the night to the sound of grunting and something nearby. I don't know for sure what it was but there
were grizzly prints in camp in the morning. About a month later I would have a pretty close grizzly encounter in the same area.</p>
<p>Morning came and we discovered that along the way we managed to put a pretty large hole in one of Luc’s bike tires. We had gone
through the effort of bringing an extra tube just in case this happened. We didn't bring an allen key to get the wheel off 
though.</p>
<p>We ended up just spending the day hiking out to the toklat river. Upon returning to camp we took a nap in the open before hiking 
out that evening. The weather was so much better.</p>

<p>The water in the wash was also much lower and not sketchy anymore. It was pretty cool to see some caribou in the wash with us
as well.</p>
<p>Overall, great trip even though we didn't even make it close to Wonder lake. We all got our biking fix and saw some cool 
wildlife along the way.</p>
