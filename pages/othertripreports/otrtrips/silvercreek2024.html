<p>Got out this weekend on a lovely little trip with my amazing girlfriend Audrey. We wanted to go on a mini overnighter to spend some time in the national forest. I also really wanted to test some flies I had tied on the hungry fish that inhabit the creek. We parked on the side of the road and after some last minute packing headed up the Silver Creek drainage. </p>

<p>We didn’t really follow a trail or anything (shhhh) since its national forest and a relatively unimpacted area compared to the rest of the greater Tahoe area. After about a mile we crossed the creek on a log when the forest got thick along with the mosquitos.</p>


<p>We found a super sick campsite amongst some granite slabs bordering the creek. Camp was set up pretty fast which allowed for an entire afternoon of fishing and swimming. Fish were plentiful and water was clear.</p>

<p>For dinner, we packed in olive basil spread, roasted peppers, artichoke hearts, and some focaccia bread. The jars were heavy but it was worth the extra weight (Audrey carried it for us).</p>

<p>In the morning we went on a nice little hike up the creek and dismantled a handful of rock cairns that were of no use. It was getting pretty hot and we wanted to make it back to the Strawberry Station for a beer so we left kind of early.</p>

<p>Overall we had an amazing time and I can’t wait to go back to Silver Creek now that I know the camping opportunities are pretty cool. This would be a great beginner trip or just a chill overnighter to get away from everything.</p>
