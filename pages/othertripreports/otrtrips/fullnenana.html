<p>Out of all of the trips I went on in 2023, this is 100% in the top 5. Maybe even in my top 5 trips of all time. To be fair, I think this trip was a highlight for every single person that attended. Shoutout to Ian for putting this entire thing together! It wouldn't have happened without him.</p>
<p>
  <em>Disclaimer: I'm not a raft guide and haven't done much rafting research so lots of the terminology I use is probably going to be semi incorrect. That's alright though, you’ll get the idea.</em>
</p>
<p>From the day I arrived in Alaska, back in June of 2023, I was hearing about this trip. We even blocked out the calendar on the company schedule to make room to go on this. It was important.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, this trip is just a (nearly) full float of the Nenana River. The Nenana is 140 miles long and is sourced from glaciers at the base of Mount Deborah. The main glacier that feeds the upper river is the Nenana Glacier. The river runs through braids, valleys, a canyon, and more braids before flowing into the Tanana river. The only part of the river we did not run was the section from the glaciers to the confluence of Brushkana Creek and the Nenana which was about 7 miles if I remember correctly.</p>
<p>The days leading up to the trip were filled with excitement. New friends were flying in from all over the US and staying at raft camp. We were shopping for supplies and beer every day. All the boats and trinkets were getting packed up.</p>
<p>The morning of the trip we hit Creekside Cafe as our last “nice” breakfast for a couple days. Not going to lie though the food we had on the trip was pretty good. Then, we all crammed into the shuttle cars and continued to the put in. I think there were 3 or 4 of us crammed in the back of a borrowed tacoma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An hour later we took a break on the side of the Old Denali Highway to stash some gear we wouldn't need yet along with another raft or two. The plan was to have one night of lightweight camping on the Brushkana and then live it up party style for the rest of the trip.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Brushkana, I was put in the back of the raft while Trinidad and Ian R2d. My job was to fish. High stakes. There are grayling in the Brushkana that I've caught before so we figured it'd be fun to catch fish for dinner. When fishing from shore, it seems as if the grayling would go after a stick if you throw it in the right current. I learned though that fishing from a raft in class 2 and 3 rapids is much harder. Unfortunately I got skunked. Somewhere, there's a video of Ian and Trinidad running the hardest rapids on the creek as I attempt to untangle the rod.</p>
<p>The technical section on the Brushkana is short and then becomes more of a float. We pulled into a campsite further down the creek that we intended to use although it was occupied by moose hunters.</p>
<p>Normally, everyone that far out there is alone on purpose, so we left them alone just to be safe.</p>
<p>As we were getting back onto the water to head to the Nenana, zeke accidentally pushed the FatCat too far away and had to jump and swim after it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our camp that night was on a nice hill overlooking the river. A few others and I engineered a tarp in a tree that protected us all from the rain as we winded down for the evening. That night, dinner was just backpacking meals as it was our ultralight day.</p>
<p>Day 2 was pretty fun. If I remember correctly, I started the day with Zeke and Marcus in a little Sotar. Zeke and I R2d and Marcus was in charge of handing us beers when ours were empty. The previous night,the tops of all the mountains got some snow. The sights were pretty insane and the vibes were mellow. Half way through the day we met back with the road briefly to grab all the stashed gear and meet up with Alicia, Andy, and Laura. The three of them had camped near all the gear to guard it and then would join us. Props to them for doing that!</p>
<p>At the road, we also dropped off Trinidad and Zeke to get a ride back into town. They planned to go to a travel agency convention that evening, then pickup firewood and beer. That night, they would hike 10 miles with all the supplies to meet back up with us. More on that later.</p>

<p>We did a switcheroo on all the boats and I ended up R2ing with Mariah. We had a wine bag with us and the river was mellow. All was well. That day was more of a float than anything so it was nice to just sit and soak in the sun and talk about outdoor things.</p>
<p>We passed a group of moose hunters that had used a raft to cross the river and get access to the land on the other side. Their raft was pretty packed still and their camp had a ton of stuff. Someone asked them how they would get a moose back on the raft if they got one. “We’ll figure it out”, they said. Again someone asked, “What if a bear comes and gets it?” They replied that they have a bear tag too!&nbsp;</p>
<p>They watched us as our convoy passed by and then we set up camp around the next bend.</p>
<p>For dinner, Andy and Laura broke out a dutch oven and made chicken wings over the fire. They were insane. I don't know if they'll ever read this but if they do thank you for the wings and I'll probably remember them for the rest of my life. All I had eaten that day was like cliff bars and wine, so wings hit the spot. ALSO, Ian brought a pizza oven. A whole pizza oven, and some dough from the restaurant down the street from raft camp. We all made pizzas too and went to bed full.</p>
<p>The only issue as we were going to bed was that Trinidad and Zeke were still not back yet. I figured that they would eventually make it into camp and went to bed. Now, Trinidad and Zeke are both very competent in backcountry navigation as hiking guides, so I wasn't concerned. After all, maybe they got held up at the convention.</p>
<p>Anyway at about 6 am i awoke to Trinidad raising a ruckus saying that Zeke needed help. I got up immediately and he told me that Zeke was about 3 miles up the river and I needed to go get him. From what I gathered, Trinidad and Zeke had hiked through the night and Zeke couldn't make it. They left all the gear with Zeke while Trinidad quested on to find us. They had an inflatable kayak with them which was key in the rescue. Trinidad passed out nearly immediately as I was gathering supplies.</p>
<p>As the only hiking guide left on the trip with off trail nav skills and first aid training, it was my job to go find Zeke and bring him back safely. I brought food, water, jackets since Zeke would be cold, a First aid kit, and a pump. Then I suited up in my drysuit and quested up river. About a mile upstream, I had to swim across a braid that was too deep to walk across. Two miles later I saw a hill next to “where all the braids come together” similar to that of what Trinidad described. I called Zeke's name but got no reply. 20 yards further I called out for him again and then saw some movement just ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zeke was sitting there in a bush! Apparently not replying because he thought he was hallucinating voices as he'd later tell me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went over to him, got him warm, and gave him food and water. The next step was to pump up the inflatable kayak which proved to be difficult for me given I had never seen one of these things in my life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>THEN, I proceeded to paddle class 2 rapids back to camp, with two full ass guys crammed in a one person inflatable kayak, one of which was asleep from exhaustion. This was my first time ever whitewater kayaking and first time ever in an inflatable kayak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everyone cheered when we got back to camp and food was pushed into our hands as a reward for our efforts.</p>
<p>Trinidad and Zeke tell an epic story about what happened that night, and I'm not even going to attempt to do it justice. But in short, the night involved about 10 miles of bogs and cliffs, losing all the beer and firewood, losing our company Garmin Inreach, breaking the backpack, then realizing they don't have a pump for the kayak once they got to the river. Also, Zeke stayed awake the entire time so he could yell at the moose hunters that he wasn't a moose when they shot in the valley.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zeke and Trinidad slept while we got the camp ready to move.</p>

<p>Today was already an exciting day and we haven't even moved yet. Not only that, but today was the day I got to pump up Ian’s Stand Up Paddle board. All week I had been so hyped to use it after I found out we could bring it. Check out the photos of that thing, it's awesome! The first half of the day was all a float with amazing adventure braids. You could drink from the wine bag strapped to the creature craft, but you had to kick it first (slapping it was too easy).</p>
<p>The second part of the day was even more adventure braids, except with some class 2 and class 3 rapids thrown in. I learned very fast that I cannot stand up on a SUP in class 2.&nbsp; Class 2 is easy on your knees though. Class 3 gets a little bit more difficult. That day I swam a lot…</p>
<p>The camp that night was pretty cool. It was on a gravel bar in the middle of the river. You can actually see the gravel bar island in my Panorama Mountain trip report. The evening was spent watching the bank erode, causing it to dump trees into the river. Obstacles for tomorrow. Flows were at a high at this point in the trip so lots was changing on the river.</p>
<p>The bonfire we had that night was pretty good as well. We used the fire to heat up a bunch of rocks for a sauna later that night. For the saunas, we would put a bunch of red hot rocks in a pile and then surround it with an ice fishing tent. Then, you dump water on the rocks and steam away. We took breaks to run and jump into the Nenana before the next round. This was the best sauna of the trip since Andy and Laura somehow crafted some brownies in their dutch oven and gave them to everyone to snack on. Straight magic</p>
<p>Day 4 we packed up camp and continued down the river. I think we ran the Super Scenic, Scenic, Wildy, and Canyon this day. I took the SUP on the Super Scenic and Scenic but ditched it at the beginning of the Wildy. More class 3 for the SUP including a rather large swim that also resulted in broken fins on the board. I stuck near Jay and Zeke who were R2ing that day and the vibes were unmatched.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the beginning of the wildy Jen and I teamed up in Alicia's boat as she went into town to get supplies. Jen had all the boating skills so I was navigator while she rowed. Rowing was still a little difficult for me but I was able to do a large section of the Wildy comfortably.</p>
<p>The one part of the Wildy that is kind of sketchy is Yanert Falls. That rapid is the only rapid on the Wildy that has killed anyone before. If you drop into the falls directly, your boat gets recirculated and you can't get out. The deaths on that rapid happened in that exact fashion, and the victims never even left the boat. That's how violent it can be.</p>
<p>Ian wanted to run the rapid straight on in his creature craft, so he booted Trinidad onto our boat for the time being.</p>
<p>We watched from below as Ian hit the rapid head on. Immediately, gear absolutely FLEW off the raft (including our wine bag). For about 15 minutes, the Creature Craft, along with Ian, was recirculated through the rapid. We were able to collect a paddle and the wine bag from the river.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luckily, Ian came out alright, only sustaining a fractured rib. Additionally, one of the oars on the creature craft completely snapped in half.</p>
<p>Everyone pulled off the river real quick and recomposed themselves.</p>
<p>A couple minutes later we were down at KFC Beach and gearing up for The Canyon. At the time of the trip, water levels were at nearly the highest they had been all season. Just days before, the water was the highest it had been in the past couple of years. Check out the video of Coffee Grinder on the highwater trip report. It's insane.</p>
<p>Anyway, getting through the canyon at that flow would require some skill if we didn't want to portage with all the gear. The main issue was we didn't want to portage Dora, the gear boat, that was an absolute tank and carried nearly everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get around that, Marcus, a very skilled whitewater guide, was going to row Dora down the canyon. I think Ian took Alicias boat. Andy and Laura took their boat. And everyone else was piled into one of the company boats as a paddle crew with Owen rowing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miraculously, everything went smoothly. Coffee Grinder didn't cause any issues that day, luckily, and it wasn't as scary as when we ran it a couple days prior. Again, check that out. After Coffee Grinder Owen let me row the boat for the rest of the stretch.</p>
<p>Camp that night was near Healy Beach.</p>
<p>Day 5 started with pancakes. Someone had foraged for a bunch of Highbush Cranberries and made a syrup with it. Truly Luxury. Apparently during the night everyone that was sleeping had missided a pretty good Northern Lights show. I guess they tried to wake me up but couldnt get me to budge. Overall, t was a pretty lazy morning as there wasn't too much ground to cover.</p>

    <figcaption>Annie and I hitching a ride on Dora as Ian rows. I was very cold and wet here.</figcaption>
    </figure>

<p>I started the day in Marcus’s inflatable kayak so we could hit some nice adventure braids. As we continued down, the river got more mellow, but also more “class tree” from all the debris. At one point, I got pretty cold so I hopped in Dora with Ian and Annie.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dora was so heavy that it was able to dredge pathways through the riverbed when the water was too shallow to pass through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was only one mishap that day when Annie tripped/slipped/something getting off the FatCat. She fell in the water and her drysuit caught on the oar tower, ripping the pant leg. Her leg was caught up on the oar tower, keeping her body underwater, as she floated downstream. Ian got to her and cut her off, saving her, but not the dry suit. Luckily, we had another drysuit she was able to use for the next day.</p>
<p>The group decided on another gravelbar campsite so we could have a bonfire. I'm talking about a “gather wood for hours” type of bonfire. It towered over us all. We also had some fun and made a little path from the tents to the fire to lure the group over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fire was pretty epic. Apparently, there was a nice sauna that night too, although I missed out by falling asleep too early. That's alright it was a good day regardless.</p>
<p>Day 6 started in the rain. I think it rained every day on this trip, at least for just a little. I raked up the remnants of the fire #LNT and put anything still on fire in the water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had some salmon for breakfast. Who TF brought salmon and left it out overnight in grizzly territory lol? Anyway that was good thank you for bringing the fish.</p>
<p>On the float down, I opted to only wear rain gear and no dry suit. No swimming today. Andy and Laura let me on their boat along with their dog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was much warmer in my rain gear, since my dry suit had gotten soaked in the days prior. Makes sense given it was held together with duct tape and I had been swimming pretty frequently.</p>
<p>The entire day consisted of some epic navigation through strainers. Andy killed it and took perfect lines.</p>
<p>Andy, Laura, and I were in the back of the caravan when we saw Maria get the creature craft hung up on a strainer. Not good. As we were rowing over to her to help, she was able to free the raft. At some point in the battle with the strainer, she had gotten her hand stuck between the tree and the oar tower. We had Marcus hop into the creature craft and had Mariah come into our raft.</p>
<p>I checked her CSMs (thanks WFR) and discovered that she couldn't feel or move 2 fingers. We didn't know the circulatory situation, but decided to keep her hand in the neoprene gloves she was wearing for warmth. Every 15 minutes I checked the hand as her pain increased, presumably as the adrenaline wore off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At that point, it was pretty clear that her hand was broken, or at least pretty messed up. I used an NRS cam strap to splint her arm to a stick we had in the boat. Coincidentally, Andy had grabbed the stick because he thought it looked like a penis. The situation was pretty funny other than the broken hand.&nbsp;</p>

    </figure>

<p>After the trip was over she went to the doctor and it was in fact a broken hand.</p>
<p>We ended the trip in the town of Nenana. There was some old guy yelling at us from the overpass bridge as we passed below. He thought it was cool what we were doing.</p>
<p>Everyone took their drysuits off and at this point I was able to properly splint Mariah's hand with a SAM splint and ACE bandage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trinidad's brother and my friend, Sam, picked us up in a van and brought us back to camp where we unpacked and partied to celebrate a successful adventure.</p>
<p>Again, special thanks to Ian and everyone else for making this trip possible.</p>
