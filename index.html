Welcome to the blog! This is mainly just a way to let people know what I've been up to. I'll probably just be posting lots of 
photos and maybe trip reports that friends and family can look at.
</p>

<p>I just returned to California after spending the summer in Alaska. Nearly all of my free time there was spent climbing, 
    rafting, or backpacking. I've still been climbing and backpacking a bunch since returning.
 As Winter approaches, I'm hoping to be able to get out as often as possible.
Hopefully, you'll see some of those trips here. 
</p>
