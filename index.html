This blog is mainly just a way to let people know what I've been up to. I'll probably just be posting lots of photos and maybe
 trip reports that people can look at.
</p>

<p>I just returned to California after spending the summer in Alaska where I was working as a backcountry hiking guide. Nearly all
    of my free time was spent climbing, rafting, or backpacking. Now, I'm working on finishing my degree and have spent the last 10
    weeks running up to tahoe on the weekends to climb. As Winter approaches, I'm hoping to be able to get out as often as possible.
    Hopefully, some documentation of those trips will be seen here.
