Welcome to the blog! This is mainly just a way to let people know what I've been up to. I'll probably just be posting lots of 
photos and maybe trip reports that friends and family can look at.

<!--<h2>What I've Been Up To</h2>-->

<p>I just returned to California after spending the summer in Alaska where I was working as a backcountry hiking guide. Nearly all
of my free time was spent climbing, rafting, or backpacking. Now, I'm working on finishing my degree and have spent the last 10
weeks running up to tahoe on the weekends to climb. As Winter approaches, I'm hoping to be able to get out as often as possible.
Hopefully, some documentation of those trips will be seen here.
